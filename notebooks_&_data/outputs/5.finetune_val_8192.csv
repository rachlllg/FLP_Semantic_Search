6237262_1,674,"Mr. Justice Mercur delivered the opinion of the court, November 20th 1882. Both parties claim title to this land under sheriff ’ s sale as the property of James Strouss. The defendant purchased at a sale made in December 1815, the plaintiff at one made in March 1880. The plaintiff seeks to impeach the validity of the first sale * 411on the ground that it was made in fraud of the creditors of Strouss. The law presumes that a public judicial sale is made in good faith. This presumption stands, unless overthrown by clear and satisfactory evidence of fraud or unfair means. The contention was one of fact. Much evidence Avas given bearing on the question, and some of it conflicting. The learned judge submitted the case to the jury in a clear and correct charge. He instructed them that if the sheriff ’ s sale was made with the intention of hindering, delaying or defeating creditors, and the purchaser had knowledge of such, it was null and void, although the full value of the property may have been paid ; that a sheriff ’ s sale should be free, open and untainted by fraud ; that any trick or device of a purchaser which prevents a fair sale is a fraud on creditors, and if by means of it he gets the property at less than it otherwise would have sold for, he does not obtain a good title, and it may be defeated by a subsequent sale of the property on the judgment of another creditor. To work this result the purchaser must have been guilty of some falsehood or trick before or at the time of the sale which succeeded, and he must have obtained the property for less than it otherwise would have sold. All of these are essential elements to defeat the title of the purchaser. A mere fraudulent intent or effort if not successful is not sufficient, nor is the mere fact that the property was purchased at less than its value. We think the plaintiff has no reason to complain of this declaration of the law. No error is assigned thereto. Then, as to the application of the evidence tending to establish the fraud, the court affirmed a point of the plaintiff put in these words, “ under the plaintiff ’ s evidence tending to prove fraud on the part of the defendant, the jury will consider all the separate facts in evidence, whether each fact of itself would be sufficient or not to fasten fraud on her in the premises ; and they may consider separate facts, if they are connected by the evidence and tend to prove that the [ defendant entered into and carried out a scheme or plan, to purchase the land in dispute at an under value, and for the benefit of herself, and also for the benefit of James Strouss or his family. ” We do not deem it necessary to consider seriatim the twenty - five specifications of error. We do not think the article of agreement Avas prima facie fraudulent as to creditors ; nor do we see any error in the rejection of evidence. A wide range was given to its admission. A careful reading of it has led us to the conclusion that the portions of the charge and answer to which we have referred, fairly presented the substantial features of the case to the jury.

1467030_1,2337,"217 N. J. Super. 541 ( 1987 ) 526 A. 2d 290 ALAN C. STAVER, PLAINTIFF, v. MARGARET STAVER, DEFENDANT. Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division Bergen County, Family Part. March 11, 1987. * 543 Donald L. Garber for plaintiff ( Donald L. Garber, attorney ; Michael I. Lubin on the brief ). John Fiorello for defendant ( Feldman, Feldman, Hoffman & Fiorello, attorneys ). SIMON, MARGUERITE T., J. S. C. Plaintiff husband brings this motion seeking to terminate his obligation to pay alimony to defendant pursuant to a judgment of divorce entered September 6, 1974. Defendant wife brings a cross - motion for enforcement of the judgment. At the time of the entry of the final judgment, plaintiff was employed as an ordained minister earning approximately $ 12, 000 a year. The parties entered into a consensual agreement which was incorporated into the judgment. Two pertinent stipulations of the agreement are as follows : ( 1 ) "" Said alimony of $ 500 per month shall continue in effect regardless of the effect of earnings of either party in the future. "" ( 2 ) "" The husband shall pay to the defendant counterclaimant in lieu of her rights to the plaintiff ' s pension, the sum of $ 6, 000. 00.... "" The judgment recited that the court was convinced that the stipulations were fair and just under all circumstances. Now, 12 years later, plaintiff is 62 and defendant is 64. Both parties appear to be in poor health and without substantial assets. Prior to plaintiff ' s retirement in August 1986, he was receiving $ 20, 500 ( $ 1, 708. 34 a month ) in his position as pastor. He now recieves $ 629 a month social security pension and $ 1, 500 a month pension from his former employment giving him a total of $ 2, 129 a month. Defendant wife has not worked since the entry of the judgment of divorce and her sole income * 544 is the $ 500 a month alimony and a social security pension of $ 348. By this motion, plaintiff argues that since defendant waived her pension rights as part of equitable distribution, none of his pension benefits can be considered as income for continuation of alimony. With this premise he states that he would be paying 80 % of his income from social security if alimony were to continue at the present rate. Plaintiff relies on D ' Oro v. D ' Oro, 187 N. J. Super. 377 ( Ch. Div. 1982 ), aff ' d 193 N. J. Super. 385, ( App. Div. 1984 ), as controlling. There the court considered the following question : Once a "" present value "" of a pension is equitably distributed, and the nonpensioner receives her share in immediate cash, and the pensioner ' s share is deferred, specifically "" leaving all pension benefits to the employee himself, "" can his monthly pension benefits upon his retirement be included in an income base for purposes of re - establishment of alimony? [ 187 N. J. Super. at 378 ] According to plaintiff, any consideration of his $ 1, 500 monthly pension benefits would amount to "" double dipping "" and be invalidated under D ' Oro, supra. The Appellate Division, in affirming Judge Krafte ' s decision, commented that they were not determining if enhancement of a pension by pensioner ' s earnings after termination of the marriage for equitable distribution purposes should be regarded as income for alimony purposes. 193 N. J. Super. at 387. That precise issue was never raised, for in D ' Oro the application for modification occurred within ten months of the final judgment. Here the amount of time is substantial. Therefore, this case presents an issue of first impression in New Jersey regarding the consideration of a divisible pension approach. It can be noted that no cases have been found from other jurisdictions which might prove helpful. The $ 1, 500 a month pension of plaintiff husband is the result of many years of service. A portion of that monthly amount derives from accumulated service before the filing of * 545 the complaint and a portion derives from accumulated service thereafter. Clearly, defendant has waived her right to the former and to permit its consideration as income for alimony purposes would amount to "" double dipping. "" It is this court ' s position that the portion which accrued after the date of the complaint can be considered income for purposes of determining alimony. Twelve years have elapsed since the parties ' divorce. Plaintiff continued working and continued accumulating pension benefits. Now, the respective incomes of the parties are so disparate that equity would mandate consideration of this portion of plaintiff ' s pension as income for purposes of determining alimony. Additionally, this portion of plaintiff ' s pension benefit was never included in the items subject to equitable distribution. This approach appears more practical than that suggested by dictum in D ' Oro v. D ' Oro, supra, 187 N. J. Super. at 379 - 380, which implicitly assumes this portion of a pension benefit can be considered income for purposes of alimony. The procedure suggested by D ' Oro would require the pensioner to first receive the full present value of the pension subject to equitable distribution, and then subsequent pension benefits could be considered for purposes of alimony. Following the suggestion of D ' Oro could be impractical in that it would require two court appearances rather than one, which could result in cessation and later renewal of alimony, and would not be easier to evaluate. Ascertaining the present value of the amount subject to distribution requires consideration of similar variables as ascertaining the amount of the present benefit subject to service before and after the date of the complaint. It has long been recognized that one of the primary purposes for granting alimony is to permit the wife, who contributed during the marriage, to share in the accumulation of the marital assets and to prevent her from becoming a public charge. Lynn v. Lynn, 153 N. J. Super. 377, 382 ( Ch. Div. 1977 ), * 546 rev ' d on other grounds 165 N. J. Super. 328 ( App. Div. 1979 ) ; Gugliotta v. Gugliotta, 160 N. J. Super. 160 ( Ch. Div. 1978 ), aff ' d 164 N. J. Super. 139 ( App. Div. 1978 ). It has further been determined that alimony is based upon "" need "" and that in determining the issue the court must inquire into the income of the spouse seeking alimony. D ' Arc v. D ' Arc, 164 N. J. Super. 226 ( Ch. Div. 1978 ). Under the circumstances of this case, it has been well established that if alimony were to terminate, defendant would have neither the ability nor the economic conditions that would allow her to continue to live at her present nominal standard. Therefore, this court, in considering plaintiff ' s pension benefits that have accrued since the final judgment as income, is acting in accordance with N. J. S. A. 2A : 34 - 23, which provides, in part, that after a judgment of divorce the court may make such order as to the maintenance of the parties as the case shall render fit, reasonable and just. Further, where a court determines that alimony payments should continue pursuant to a judgment, the supporting spouse ' s pension receipts would fall within the definition of sources which may be used to continue to pay alimony. N. J. S. A. 2A : 17 - 56. 8 provides as follows : Every order of a court for alimony, maintenance or child support payments shall include a written notice to the obligor stating that the order shall be enforced by an income withholding upon the current or future income due from the obligor ' s employer or successor employers and upon the unemployment compensation benefits due the obligor and against debts, income, trust funds, profits or income from any other source due the obligor [ Emphasis supplied ] Moreover, the courts have ruled that the pension of a person who is ordered to pay alimony or child support is subject to execution or garnishment in order to enforce such support obligations. Thiel v. Thiel, 41 N. J. 446 ( 1964 ) ; Ward v. Ward, 164 N. J. Super. 354 ( Ch. Div. 1978 ). Since support obligations may be adjusted from time to time, they are deemed to be a continuing obligation, and therefore * 547 the courts have also looked to the continued receipt of social security or other similar benefits as a source of income for support. Schaeffer v. Schaeffer, 184 N. J. Super. 423, 425 ( App. Div. 1982 ) ; Davis v. Davis, 184 N. J. Super 430, 441 ( App. Div. 1982 ). The second issue before the court is the enforceability of the provision in the final judgment which stipulated that "" said alimony of $ 500 per month shall continue in effect regardless of the effect of the earnings of either party in the future. "" This can be disposed of simply by noting that the agreement considered by Justice Pashman in the landmark case of Lepis v. Lepis, 83 N. J. 139, 144 ( 1980 ) also contained a provision that "" specified that the presence or absence of separate earnings by the wife, or changes in the husband ' s income, would be irrelevant to a decision to alter or halt the husband ' s payments. "" The standards enunciated in Lepis as to changed circumstances and procedures to be applied will be applicable to this case as Lepis held that the court is not bound by such provisions. The type of escalation provision considered in Petersen v. Petersen, 85 N. J. 638 ( 1981 ) is to be distinguished as it, unlike the provisions in both Lepis and this case, does vary according to the respective incomes of the parties. In addition, comments of the Court in Petersen reaffirm the Lepis standards. Here, since the portion of plaintiff ' s pension which was subject to equitable distribution cannot be considered income for purposes of establishing alimony, this court finds that plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of changed circumstances which may require a modification of alimony. An expert will be appointed to determine the amount of plaintiff ' s pension benefit which has accrued since the date of equitable distribution. This, together with plaintiff ' s social security pension, will be included in the items to be considered in determining the amount of alimony, if any, to be paid.",1467030,"217 N.J.

5239595_1,1603,"Howard, J. : By the ' will of Byron S. Briggs, which was offered for probate in the Surrogate ’ s Court of Madison county, Harriet 0. Briggs, his wife, was appointed executrix. After the surrogate had overruled certain objections to the probate of the will and announced his conclusion that the will should be admitted to probate, written objections were filed to the issuance of letters testamentary to the widow, on the ground that she had deliberately murdered the testator for the purpose of thwarting any attempt on his part to make another will. The objections were filed by the son of the testator ; and his attitude of opposition to the widow was approved by a granddaughter of the testator. These two persons were descendants of the testator by a former wife. They were legatees under the will and had a statutory right to make objections. ( See Code Civ. Proc. § 2636. ) They stood ready with the witnesses in court and offered to make proof of the serious charges which they had preferred against the proponent of the will. The surrogate declined to hear any proof on the subject and made a decree directing letters testamentary to be issued to the woman who stood before him accused of murder. Section 2612 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as it stood at the time these proceedings were instituted in June, 1914, provided that a person incompetent to execute the duties of executor by reason of dishonesty should not be appointed ; and section 2637 of the Code, as it was at that time, provided that the surrogate must inquire into objections filed against the incompetency of a person named in the will as executor ; and that he might, in * 54his discretion, receive proof of the matters alleged as objections. ( See Laws of 1893, chap. 686 ; Laws of 1880, chap. 178. ) The surrogate neither made inquiry nor took proof. He made no attempt whatever to probe into these grave, alarming and unusual charges, but rejected all such evidence and in the face of this accusation of murder he directed letters testamentary to issue to Harriet 0. Briggs. A dishonest person is one “ Wanting in honesty or integrity ; disposed to cheat or defraud ; not trustworthy. ” This is Webster ’ s definition of a dishonest person. If a wife deliberately murders her husband so as to prevent him from making another will, by which she fears he might disinherit her — murders him for the purpose of securing to herself the benefactions under the will then in existence, is she not a dishonest person within Webster ’ s definition? It is the clear purpose of the murderess, in such a case, to cheat and defraud the persons to whom the testator might devise and bequeath his estate under his new will. The whole incentive to murder is a disposition to cheat and defraud not only the possible future legatees, but the testator himself. It is not revenge, but avarice, which prompts the crime. Such a person is manifestly wanting in honesty and integrity ; and such a person is manifestly not trustworthy and is, therefore, incompetent to act as an executrix. Therefore, literally, the objections filed against the proponent herein come within section 2612 of the Code. ■ But there is a broader view of this subject which we should adopt. If there ' were no statute and no written law on the subject, it is inconceivable that the administration of justice would tolerate the appointment of a person guilty of murder under the circumstances charged here. It is a well - known maxim of the law that “ No one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, or to take advantage of his own wrong, or to found any claim upon his own iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime. ” ( Riggs v. Palmer, 115 N. Y. 506. ) It would be a scandal upon our system of jurisprudence and bring our laws into ridicule and contempt if a person proven to have murdered her husband should be invested by the law with the legal right to administer upon the very booty which she had plundered from her victim. It would be shocking for the law to * 55protect such a person in the enjoyment of the spoil of her iniquity. The position we are assuming here is amply sustained by the doctrine promulgated in Riggs v. Palmer ( supra ) and in New York Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Armstrong ( 117 U. S. 591 ). But many of the complications and difficulties which present themselves in those cases, and in Ellerson v. Westcott ( 148 N. Y. 149 ), are absent from this case. Here the statute specifically authorizes the presentation of objections to the fitness of an executor, and specifically provides that evidence may be taken to establish such objections. The surrogate in this case refused to hear any proof and the question before us is as to whether the surrogate was right in his refusal. We think he was wrong. In refusing to receive proof the surrogate said : “ I will hold I will not compel this proponent to meet the charge of murder in this civil action unless I am compelled to do so by higher authority, the Court of Appeals not having passed upon that question when they had ample opportunity to do so. I am going to take that side of it. ” But we think that the proponent should have been compelled to meet the charge of murder. The charge was presented at the proper time and in the proper place. It would have been almost criminal on the part of the son to have stood idly by while the person whom he believed to be the murderess of his father was invested by the law with the custody of his patrimony. It was his moral duty, as well as his legal right, to protest. The objections were an attack upon the woman ’ s general fitness to act as executrix, upon her integrity, upon her trustworthiness, upon her moral character, upon her probity. The charges branded her with “ dishonesty, ” the very words of the statute, and with a disposition to cheat and defraud, and with the crime of murder perpetrated, deliberately and with a mercenary motive. If it had been admitted that the proponent was guilty of the offense charged against her, it cannot be that the surrogate would have appointed her. But even assuming that the evidence would have established these charges, the surrogate felt that he ought not to hear the proof. It is possible that the proof might have established the proponent ’ s utter unfitness. There * 56fore, notwithstanding the gravity of the charges, it follows as a matter of right that the legatees who made the objections should have been afforded an opportunity to present their proof. In discussing this subject we have been compelled to refer to the charges as they were specified in the written objections. By what we have said we do not, of course, in any manner intimate that we believe the charges well founded. The proponent may be entirely innocent, and nothing that we say here should work to her detriment at the hearing which we are about to order. We are only holding that we think the learned surrogate was in error in refusing to inquire into the objections. The order of the surrogate should be reversed and a hearing granted to the contestants under the objections filed. All concurred ; Lyon, J., in result.

The objections were filed by the son of the testator; and his attitude of opposition to the widow was approved by a granddaughter of the testator. These two persons were descendants of the testator by a former wife. They were legatees under the will and had a statutory right to make objections. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2636.) They stood ready with the witnesses in court and offered to make proof of the serious charges which they had preferred against the proponent of the will. The surrogate declined to hear any proof on the subject and made a decree directing letters testamentary to be issued to the woman who stood before him accused of murder. Section 2612 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as it stood at the time these proceedings were instituted in June, 1914, provided that a person incompetent to execute the duties of executor by reason of dishonesty should not be appointed; and section 2637 of the Code, as it was at that time, provided that the surrogate must inquire into objections filed against the incompetency of a person named in the will as executor; and that he might, in *54his discretion, receive proof of the matters alleged as objections. (See Laws of 1893, chap. 686; Laws of 1880, chap. 178.) The surrogate neither made inquiry nor took proof. He made no attempt whatever to probe into these grave, alarming and unusual charges, but rejected all such evidence and in the face of this accusation of murder he directed letters testamentary to issue to Harriet 0. Briggs. A dishonest person is one “Wanting in honesty or integrity; disposed to cheat or defraud; not trustworthy.” This is Webster’s definition of a dishonest person. If a wife deliberately murders her husband so as to prevent him from making another will, by which she fears he might disinherit her — murders him for the purpose of securing to herself the benefactions under the will then in existence, is she not a dishonest person within Webster’s definition ? It is the clear purpose of the murderess, in such a case, to cheat and defraud the persons to whom the testator might devise and bequeath his estate under his new will. The whole incentive to murder is a disposition to cheat and defraud not only the possible future legatees, but the testator himself. It is not revenge, but avarice, which prompts the crime. Such a person is manifestly wanting in honesty and integrity; and such a person is manifestly not trustworthy and is, therefore, incompetent to act as an executrix. Therefore, literally, the objections filed against the proponent herein come within section 2612 of the Code. ■ But there is a broader view of this subject which we should adopt. If there' were no statute and no written law on the subject, it is inconceivable that the administration of justice would tolerate the appointment of a person guilty of murder under the circumstances charged here. It is a well-known maxim of the law that “No one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, or to take advantage of his own wrong, or to found any claim upon his own iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime.” (Riggs v. Palmer, 115 N. Y. 506.) It would be a scandal upon our system of jurisprudence and bring our laws into ridicule and contempt if a person proven to have murdered her husband should be invested by the law with the legal right to administer upon the very booty which she had plundered from her victim. It would be shocking for the law to *55protect such a person in the enjoyment of the spoil of her iniquity. The position we are assuming here is amply sustained by the doctrine promulgated in Riggs v. Palmer (supra) and in New York Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Armstrong (117 U. S. 591). But many of the complications and difficulties which present themselves in those cases, and in Ellerson v. Westcott (148 N. Y. 149), are absent from this case. Here the statute specifically authorizes the presentation of objections to the fitness of an executor, and specifically provides that evidence may be taken to establish such objections. The surrogate in this case refused to hear any proof and the question before us is as to whether the surrogate was right in his refusal. We think he was wrong. In refusing to receive proof the surrogate said: “I will hold I will not compel this proponent to meet the charge of murder in this civil action unless I am compelled to do so by higher authority, the Court of Appeals not having passed upon that question when they had ample opportunity to do so. I am going to take that side of it.” But we think that the proponent should have been compelled to meet the charge of murder. The charge was presented at the proper time and in the proper place. It would have been almost criminal on the part of the son to have stood idly by while the person whom he believed to be the murderess of his father was invested by the law with the custody of his patrimony. It was his moral duty, as well as his legal right, to protest. The objections were an attack upon the woman’s general fitness to act as executrix, upon her integrity, upon her trustworthiness, upon her moral character, upon her probity. The charges branded her with “dishonesty,” the very words of the statute, and with a disposition to cheat and defraud, and with the crime of murder perpetrated, deliberately and with a mercenary motive. If it had been admitted that the proponent was guilty of the offense charged against her, it cannot be that the surrogate would have appointed her. But even assuming that the evidence would have established these charges, the surrogate felt that he ought not to hear the proof. It is possible that the proof might have established the proponent’s utter unfitness. There*56fore, notwithstanding the gravity of the charges, it follows as a matter of right that the legatees who made the objections should have been afforded an opportunity to present their proof. In discussing this subject we have been compelled to refer to the charges as they were specified in the written objections. By what we have said we do not, of course, in any manner intimate that we believe the charges well founded. The proponent may be entirely innocent, and nothing that we say here should work to her detriment at the hearing which we are about to order. We are only holding that we think the learned surrogate was in error in refusing to inquire into the objections. The order of the surrogate should be reversed and a hearing granted to the contestants under the objections filed. All concurred; Lyon, J., in result. Order of the surrogate reversed and hearing granted to the contestants, with costs.

3531217_1,3227,"The purpose of this proceeding is twofold. First, to construe a will and, second, to partition the property in controversy. The will in question is that of C. C. Broyles and Margaret I., his wife. It is joint and bears date of April 11, 1889. C. C. Broyles died in 1896 ; Margaret I. Broyles died in 1924. The will was duly proved in the Probate Court of Barton County, in January, 1896. The plaintiffs, as well as the defendants, are the heirs at law of C. C. Broyles. The burden of the first count of the petition is that the terms of the will are too indefinite and uncertain to render the same operative as a devise of the real estate referred to. If this contention be sustained a partition will be authorized. Otherwise not. The paragraphs ( 3 and 4 ) of the will seeking construction are as follows : "" 3. At Margaret I. Broyles ' death and after the expense of her last sickness and funeral has been paid, I direct my executors to transfer and deed all of my remaining estate to the trustees of Ozark College, an institution of learning owned and controlled by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, situated at Greenfield, Dade County, Missouri, as an endowment fund to be loaned on real estate security perpetually, from year to year ; the interest to be used to pay the school expenses of worthy young men, who are not able to educate themselves, and who declare their intention to become lifelong ministers of the Gospel in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. "" 4. And if by any means or circumstances, the said Ozark College goes from the ownership of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, or its control, then the nearest College, to the said Ozark College, that is owned and controlled by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and is without incumbrance, or indebtedness shall become heir to the endowment fund as above described. "" The contention of Missouri Valley College, which was permitted to intervene, is that when Ozark College ceased to exist in the year 1901, it thereby terminated its connection with and was no longer under the control of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and that the Missouri Valley College, being at the time the nearest college to said Ozark College owned and controlled by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, and without incumbrance or indebtedness, became, under the terms of said will, entitled to the property or endowment fund mentioned in the will, subject to the life estate of Margaret I. Broyles. Further than this, that in the year 1906 there was a union or merger of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and the Presbyterian * Page 74 Church in the United States of America, and that at the time of the death of Margaret I. Broyles in 1924, Missouri Valley College was the nearest college to said Ozark College, which in truth and in fact, was owned and controlled by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church without incumbrance or indebtedness ; that by the terms of the will Missouri Valley College became entitled to the remainder in said property at the time Ozark College went out of existence in 1901, subject to the termination of the life estate. Bethel College, of the State of Tennessee, filed an answer and intervening petition in the cause, alleging that at the time of the death of Margaret I. Broyles in 1924, it was the nearest college to Ozark College, then owned and controlled by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, without incumbrance or indebtedness. The issues were joined as aforesaid and upon a hearing a decree was entered in favor of the plaintiffs from which the interveners have appealed. I. The respondents contend that the grantee or beneficiary named in the will of C. C. Broyles after Ozark College ceased to exist is so indefinitely designated as to be incapable of identification. This contention is based on the rule that certainty of the identity of a devisee is necessary Indefinite to the validity of the will. There is no ground for Devisee. controversy as to the correctness of this rule under a proper state of facts. Supplemental thereto, however, and equally fundamental in the construction of a will, is the rule, that if a will is ambiguous in the designation of the beneficiary and can be made definite by evidence aliunde, such evidence is admissible to determine the intention of the testator. As illustrative of the application of these rules we held in Griffith v. Witten, 252 Mo. 627, 641, that if a will is susceptible of construction and expresses a defined purpose, and that purpose contemplates the disposition of the testator ' s property, it will not be held to be void. The rule is stated more broadly in the later case of St. L. Union Tr. Co. v. Little ( Mo. ), 10 S. W. 2d 47 and cases at page 51 et seq., to the effect that a will cannot be held to be void for uncertainty, unless it is absolutely impossible to put a fair meaning upon the terms used. In all of these cases the pole star of interpretation is the testator ' s intention. This cardinal doctrine has found recent expression in Coleman v. Haworth ( Mo. ), 8 S. W. 2d 93, in which it is held that a court must find the testator ' s general purpose, reconcile the conflicting provisions, if reasonably possible, and reduce the testator ' s intent to articulate terms. In an early case, Barkley v. Donnelly, 112 Mo. 561, the will contained a devise providing for the establishment of a home and place for the maintenance and education of poor children and it was held * Page 75 not to be too indefinite and uncertain in its terms to be enforced in equity. In the cases cited by the respondents to sustain their contention as to the invalidity of the will on account of uncertainty it will be found upon examination that the facts in those cases in which it was held that the wills there under review were void for uncertainty, are entirely different from those in the instant case. They cannot, therefore, be fairly held to support the respondents ' contention. II. In the light of the facts, therefore, guided by the rule of construction stated, is the will of C. C. Broyles void for uncertainty? Preliminary to a detailed statement of the facts it is beyond controversy that upon the death of When Contingent C. C. Broyles the title to his property, subject Remainder to the life estate of Margaret I. Broyles, was Becomes Vested. invested in Ozark College, then owned and controlled by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, which said property was to constitute an endowment fund to be loaned upon real estate security, perpetually from year to year, the interest arising therefrom to be used to defray the cost of education of young men unable to educate themselves and whose intentions are to become life ministers of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. At the time of the making of C. C. Broyles ' s will and at his death, Ozark College was under the jurisdiction of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and was engaged in the education of young men for the ministry of that church. The devise, therefore, so far as concerns Ozark College is not assailed for uncertainty, if said college had been in existence at the time of the death of Margaret I. Broyles. It is contended, however, that since Ozark College ceased to exist in 1901 and on account of the merger of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church with the Presbyterian Church in the United States, in 1906, that the beneficiary has become indefinite and uncertain. The corporate character of the Missouri Valley College as an educational institution devoted to the education of ministers of the Presbyterian Church is not denied, or if denied it is enough to say that it is affirmatively shown by the testimony ; nor is there any dispute that at the time Ozark College ceased to exist in 1901 it passed out of the control and jurisdiction of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and that Missouri Valley College was at the time the nearest college to Ozark College, owned and controlled by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. The contention is made, however, that the remainder in the property devised by C. C. Broyles did not vest in Missouri Valley College at the time Ozark College ceased to exist, but if at all, upon the death of Margaret I. Broyles in 1924, and that at that time Missouri Valley College had ceased to be Cumberland * Page 76 Presbyterian in character. C. C. Broyles was the owner of the fee in the land devised. Upon his death his will became operative, so far as concerns the beneficiaries named and the estates created. Upon his widow Margaret I. Broyles not only acquiescing in the will and refusing to renounce its provisions she became invested with the life tenancy and by operation of law, under the terms of the will, the other beneficiaries became entitled to remainders, subject to the contingencies mentioned. Under these facts it is evident that the estates created began to exist upon his death and not that of his wife. Incidentally, it is contended, notwithstanding uncontradicted testimony to the contrary, that the Missouri Valley College was not under the control of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church at the time Ozark College ceased to exist, because it was controlled by a board of trustees, although such trustees were elected by a synod of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. It is a sufficient answer to this contention that the courts held that boards which incorporate civic organizations such as the Missouri Valley College are but agencies or instrumentalities of the church and subject to its control, ownership and dominion. [ Helm v. Zarecor, 222 U. S. 32 ; Synod of Kansas v. Mo. Valley College, 208 Fed. l. c. 324 ; Barkley v. Hayes, 208 F. 319 ; Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 379. ] Under the testimony, therefore, and the rulings of the Federal courts above cited, when Ozark College ceased to exist Missouri Valley College, being a corporate entity, owned and controlled by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and the nearest college of that character to Ozark College, Missouri Valley College, under the clear terms of the will and subject to the life estate of Margaret I. Broyles, became invested with a remainder in the estate devised. This estate, under the express terms of the will, was subject to a condition subsequent, that upon Ozark College ceasing to exist or as the will has it ( Par. 4 ), "" goes from the ownership of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, or its control, then the nearest college owned and controlled by said church, without incumbrance or indebtedness, shall become heir to the endowment fund above described. "" III. The title or estate of Missouri Valley College upon the death of the testator was that of a contingent remainder to become vested, upon the termination of the life estate and the passing of Ozark College from the control and ownership of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. In this connection it may be added that so far as concerns the rights and Upon Happening property interests of Missouri Valley College, of Contingency. under the will, they are unaffected by the character of the estate granted to Ozark College, whether vested or contingent. Upon the happening of the * Page 77 contingencies mentioned, the interest of the nearest college of like faith to Ozark College became vested. Numerous authorities sustain the conclusion that the law favors vested estates and where there is doubt as to whether an estate is vested or contingent the courts will construe it to be vested. [ Tindall v. Tindall, 167 Mo. l. c. 225 ; Chew v. Keller, 100 Mo. l. c. 368. ] Furthermore, the rule is that an estate shall be held to vest at the earliest possible moment in the absence of a contrary intention manifested in the grant. [ Warne v. Sorge, 258 Mo. l. c. 171 ; Heady v. Hollman, 251 Mo. 632. ] See also Green v. Irvin, 309 Mo. 302, where many cases on vested and contingent remainders are cited and considered. IV. The respondents, although conceding the certainty or definiteness of the devise to Ozark College and that it is in the nature of a charitable trust, contend that there existed no lawful taker when that college ceased to exist or, in other words, that there is no such designation in the will, Indefinite as the law requires, to create the trust. This Taker. contention is not supported by the facts. It was shown without contradiction that Missouri Valley College was a corporate entity ; that it was of the faith and doctrine of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church ; that its proximity to Ozark College at the time the latter ceased to exist was, under the terms of the will, such as to entitle it to the estate, subject to the life tenure of Margaret I. Broyles. V. It is also contended that after the merger in 1906 of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church with the Presbyterian Church of the United States, Ozark College, having ceased to exist in 1901, the beneficiary was rendered so uncertain as to Merger of destroy any claim of Missouri Valley College to the Churches. endowment under the terms of the will. This contention is based upon the mistaken assumption that the right of Missouri Valley College to a remainder did not arise until the death of the life tenant, Margaret I. Broyles, in 1924. We have adverted to the fact, which we repeat, that the right of the college as a remainderman came into existence upon the death of the testator in 1896. While it was contingent in its nature, first, upon the determination of the life estate, and second, upon Ozark College ceasing to exist, neither contingency can in reason render less certain the terms of the will or lessen the interest of Missouri Valley College, in the endowment fund. In addition, it appears that at the time of the merger of the two churches there was no material difference between their respective cardinal doctrines. Their merger therefore was purely material and did not affect either their faith or practice and the assumed passing out, * Page 78 as contended by the respondents, of Missouri Valley College from the ownership of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, cannot be said to be more than nominal. This aside, however, the prior creation of Missouri Valley College ' s interest in the endowment fund and its continued existence forestalls any argument that may be made as to the effect of the merger upon that interest. We, therefore, hold that there is no vagueness or uncertainty in the will, either as to the beneficiaries or the nature of the interest devised ; and that Missouri Valley College became entitled, upon the termination of the contingencies mentioned, to a vested interest in the endowment fund provided for in the will for the purposes therein defined. This finding forecloses the claim of Bethel College to any interest in the endowment fund and denies the claims thereto of the respondents as heirs at law of C. C. Broyles. The judgment of the trial court is, therefore, reversed and remanded with directions to proceed herein as indicated in this opinion. All concur.",3531217,"The purpose of this proceeding is twofold. First, to construe a will and, second, to partition the property in controversy. The will in question is that of C.C. Broyles and Margaret I., his wife. It is joint and bears date of April 11, 1889. C.C. Broyles died in 1896; Margaret I. Broyles died in 1924. The will was duly proved in the Probate Court of Barton County, in January, 1896. The plaintiffs, as well as the defendants, are the heirs at law of C.C. Broyles. The burden of the first count of the petition is that the terms of the will are too indefinite and uncertain to render the same operative as a devise of the real estate referred to. If this contention be sustained a partition will be authorized. Otherwise not. The paragraphs (3 and 4) of the will seeking construction are as follows: ""3. At Margaret I. Broyles' death and after the expense of her last sickness and funeral has been paid, I direct my executors to transfer and deed all of my remaining estate to the trustees of Ozark College, an institution of learning owned and controlled by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, situated at Greenfield, Dade County, Missouri, as an endowment fund to be loaned on real estate security perpetually, from year to year; the interest to be used to pay the school expenses of worthy young men, who are not able to educate themselves, and who declare their intention to become lifelong ministers of the Gospel in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.

The issues were joined as aforesaid and upon a hearing a decree was entered in favor of the plaintiffs from which the interveners have appealed. I.

The title or estate of Missouri Valley College upon the death of the testator was that of a contingent remainder to become vested, upon the termination of the life estate and the passing of Ozark College from the control and ownership of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. In this connection it may be added that so far as concerns the rights and Upon Happening property interests of Missouri Valley College, of Contingency . under the will, they are unaffected by the character of the estate granted to Ozark College, whether vested or contingent. Upon the happening of the *Page 77 contingencies mentioned, the interest of the nearest college of like faith to Ozark College became vested. Numerous authorities sustain the conclusion that the law favors vested estates and where there is doubt as to whether an estate is vested or contingent the courts will construe it to be vested. [Tindall v. Tindall, 167 Mo. l.c. 225; Chew v. Keller, 100 Mo. l.c. 368.] Furthermore, the rule is that an estate shall be held to vest at the earliest possible moment in the absence of a contrary intention manifested in the grant. [Warne v. Sorge, 258 Mo. l.c. 171; Heady v. Hollman, 251 Mo. 632 .] See also Green v. Irvin, 309 Mo. 302 , where many cases on vested and contingent remainders are cited and considered. IV. The respondents, although conceding the certainty or definiteness of the devise to Ozark College and that it is in the nature of a charitable trust, contend that there existed no lawful taker when that college ceased to exist or, in other words, that there is no such designation in the will, Indefinite as the law requires, to create the trust. This Taker . contention is not supported by the facts. It was shown without contradiction that Missouri Valley College was a corporate entity; that it was of the faith and doctrine of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church; that its proximity to Ozark College at the time the latter ceased to exist was, under the terms of the will, such as to entitle it to the estate, subject to the life tenure of Margaret I. Broyles. V. It is also contended that after the merger in 1906 of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church with the Presbyterian Church of the United States, Ozark College, having ceased to exist in 1901, the beneficiary was rendered so uncertain as to Merger of destroy any claim of Missouri Valley College to the Churches . endowment under the terms of the will. This contention is based upon the mistaken assumption that the right of Missouri Valley College to a remainder did not arise until the death of the life tenant, Margaret I. Broyles, in 1924. We have adverted to the fact, which we repeat, that the right of the college as a remainderman came into existence upon the death of the testator in 1896. While it was contingent in its nature, first, upon the determination of the life estate, and second, upon Ozark College ceasing to exist, neither contingency can in reason render less certain the terms of the will or lessen the interest of Missouri Valley College, in the endowment fund. In addition, it appears that at the time of the merger of the two churches there was no material difference between their respective cardinal doctrines. Their merger therefore was purely material and did not affect either their faith or practice and the assumed passing out, *Page 78 as contended by the respondents, of Missouri Valley College from the ownership of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, cannot be said to be more than nominal. This aside, however, the prior creation of Missouri Valley College's interest in the endowment fund and its continued existence forestalls any argument that may be made as to the effect of the merger upon that interest. We, therefore, hold that there is no vagueness or uncertainty in the will, either as to the beneficiaries or the nature of the interest devised; and that Missouri Valley College became entitled, upon the termination of the contingencies mentioned, to a vested interest in the endowment fund provided for in the will for the purposes therein defined. This finding forecloses the claim of Bethel College to any interest in the endowment fund and denies the claims thereto of the respondents as heirs at law of C.C. Broyles. The judgment of the trial court is, therefore, reversed and remanded with directions to proceed herein as indicated in this opinion.

6199131_1,1499,"OPINION OF THE COURT Sidney Leviss, J. In this action brought pursuant to subdivision 12 of section 63 of the Executive Law and sections 476 - a and 476 - b of the Judiciary Law, plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction restraining defendants from the unauthorized practice of law. Plaintiff alleges that defendants give legal advice to customers of so - called "" divorce kits ”. By order of this court dated April 18, 1978 defendants ’ answer was stricken for failure to disclose. Plaintiff now moves without opposition for judgment. From the complaint and supporting affidavits it appears that defendants go beyond the mere selling of divorce kits to the public and in fact aid in the selection and preparation of the forms by giving legal advice. An investigator from plain * 341tiffs office posed as a potential customer of a divorce kit and visited the premises of defendants in Queens. After listening to the investigator ’ s marital problems, defendant Wolfe, an employee of the corporate defendants, helped him select the proper grounds for divorce under section 170 of the Domestic Relations Law, and advised him, inadequately, on the meaning of cruel and inhuman treatment. In response to the investigator ’ s questions, defendant Wolfe further advised him about his obligation to pay alimony and about his obligation to pay debts contracted during marriage. Defendant Wolfe offered to type and file the papers for the investigator for an additional fee. At defendants ’ Nassau - Suffolk office, defendant Jean Marie, who manages that office, also advised the investigator about the grounds for divorce, his liability for marital debts, and the probability of his having to pay alimony in light of the particular circumstances of the marital parties. Defendant Jean Marie advised and induced the investigator to "" makeup ” a third marital fight which she believed was needed to establish cruel and inhuman treatment. Another investigator went to defendants ’ Queens office, where she met with defendant Wolfe. After listening to the investigator describe her marital circumstances, defendant Wolfe advised her to seek a divorce on the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment. He advised her that she would need three incidents involving physical or mental mistreatment. He urged the investigator to return to him so that he might review the papers for errors. When the investigator returned to the office a few days later saying that she was confused, defendant Kay, an employee of the corporate defendants, for a further fee, drew the papers including the paragraph of the complaint alleging cruel and inhuman treatment. In sum, the facts as alleged by the affidavits of the two investigators show that the defendants are not merely engaged in the sale of a book of forms to the public, which plaintiff admits is proper in itself, but in also giving specific legal advice to individuals. In Matter of New York County Lawyers ’ Assn. v Dacey ( 21 NY2d 694 ) the Court of Appeals reversed an injunction against the sale of forms on the dissenting opinion of Justice Stevens ( Matter of New York County Lawyers ’ Assn. v Dacey, 28 AD2d 161, 171 ). Justice Stevens drew a distinction between the practice of law and the mere sale of a book of forms, stating ( p 174 ) : "" Dacey ’ s book is sold to the public at * 342large. There is no personal contact or relationship with a particular individual, nor does there exist that relation of confidence and trust so necessary to the status of attorney and client. This is the essential of legal practice — the representation and advising of a particular person in a particular situation. ” ( Emphasis added. ) In State of New York v Winder ( 42 AD2d 1039 ), the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, held that the publication and sale of divorce kits similar to those sold by defendants herein did not constitute the unlawful practice of law because the publication itself did not give personal advice on specific problems to individuals. The court quoted the distinction drawn by Justice Stevens in Matter of New York County Lawyers ’ Assn, v Dacey and found that selling the kit did not constitute the advising of a particular person in a particular situation ( State of New York v Winder, supra ). However, the Appellate Division found that defendants went beyond the mere selling of the kit and gave legal advice to individuals concerning particular problems which might arise in the preparation and presentation of the documents. Therefore, the court upheld that part of the injunction directed against those practices. ( State of New York v Winder, supra, p 1040. ) In the case at bar, defendants ’ actions constituted the unlawful practice of law. ( Judiciary Law, § 476 - a et seq. ; Matter of New York County Lawyers ’ Assn, v Dacey, supra ; State of New York v Winder, supra. ) Specific advice, often erroneous and inadequate, was given to particular individuals in light of their particular circumstances. Defendants advised individuals on the choice of grounds for divorce, on the disposition of jointly owned property, on the legality of alimony arrangements, on responsibility for marital debts, and on the drawing of legal papers. Rules for the admission of practice to law, rules regulating the conduct of the bar, and laws against the unauthorized practice of law were enacted to protect the public from ignorance, inexperience, and unscrupulousness. ( People v Alfani, 227 NY 334. ) Defendants ’ conduct makes it apparent that the rationale underlying these rules is very sound. Defendants not only attempt to give legal advice in a sensitive area of the law, where the interests of spouses and children are at stake, but they also give out erroneous information and counsel perjury. One example of this occurred when defendant Jean Marie encouraged the investigator to perjure himself about a * 343third fight supposedly needed to establish cruel and inhuman treatment. Other incomplete or erroneous advice given by defendants and relating, for example, to the husband ’ s obligation to pay alimony and his responsibility for marital debts convinces the court that the injunction sought by the plaintiff is needed for the protection of the public. Accordingly, the court grants the injunction sought by plaintiff insofar as the plaintiff seeks to enjoin defendants from the unauthorized practice of law by : ( 1 ) giving legal advice to customers about their marital problems ; ( 2 ) giving legal advice to customers by selecting for them proper forms on the basis of their individual circumstances ; and ( 3 ) giving legal advice by aiding and assisting individual customers in filling out legal forms. The court must deny that part of the complaint which seeks to enjoin defendants from personally selling the kits. ( New York County Lawyers ’ Assn, v Dacey, 21 NY2d 694, supra. ) Sale of forms, even face - to - face without the giving of legal advice, is not subject to injunction.

Appellees instituted an action in the county court to condemn a right of way 100 feet wide, 9, 981 feet long, across the tract, containing 22. 95 acres, for its high - power electric line, under section 1599b, Kentucky Statutes, which provides that the proceedings shall be in conformity to sections 835 - 840, Kentucky Statutes. Commissioners were appointed, who fixed the damages at $ 1, 000. The landowners filed exceptions to the commissioners ' report in the county court, and, the case being heard before a jury, there was a verdict fixing the damages at $ 2, 295. The landowners declined to accept the money. The company paid the amount into court and took possession of the property. Both parties then took an appeal to the circuit court. In the circuit court, the company filed exceptions to the commissioners ' report on the ground that the amount allowed was excessive, and, when the case came on for trial, asked that the company be adjudged the burden of proof. The landowners objected, but the motion was sustained. The jury in the circuit court, after viewing the property, fixed the damages at $ 1, 600. * Page 77 The circuit court entered judgment pursuant to the verdict. The landowners appeal. In Shelbyville Turnpike Co. v. L. N. R. R. Co., 51 S. W. 805, 21 Ky. Law Rep. 548, where both the landowner and the company filed exceptions in the county court to the commissioners ' report, it was held, when the case reached the circuit court, that the burden of proof rested on the company, and this was followed in Calor Oil Co. v. Franzell ( Ky. ) 122 S. W. 188. But in Chicago, etc., Railroad Co. v. Rottgering, 83 S. W. 584, 26 Ky. Law Rep. 1167, it was held that the landowner, who alone excepted to the award of damages by the commissioners, was properly allowed the burden of proof and the right to the closing argument to the jury. Sections 838 - 839 provide : "" At the first regular term of the county court, after the owners shall have been summoned the length of time prescribed by the Civil Code of Practice before an answer is required, it shall be the duty of the court to examine said report, and if it shall appear to be in conformity to this law, and to the extent that no exceptions have been filed thereto by either party, it shall confirm said report as against the owners not excepting. "" When exceptions shall be filed by either party, the court shall forthwith cause a jury to be impaneled to try the issues of fact made by the exceptions. . . . Either party may appeal to the circuit court, by executing bond as required in other cases, within thirty days and the appeal shall be tried de novo, upon the confirmation of the report of the commissioners by the county court, or the assessment of damages by said court, as herein provided. "" The statute clearly contemplates that the exceptions shall be filed at the first regular term of the county court after the owners have been duly summoned, and that the case shall be tried by the jury on the exceptions so filed. When an appeal is taken to the circuit court, the case is tried de novo, but it is the case that was tried in the county court. Here the company filed no exceptions in the county court, and was willing to accept the report of the commissioners. For the first time it filed exceptions in the circuit court simply for the purpose of obtaining the burden of proof and the right to the concluding argument in the circuit court. The statute clearly was intended to provide an expeditious mode for settling * Page 78 the rights of the parties at the first term of the county court, after the parties were before the court. It does not contemplate that the party who makes no exception to the commissioners ' report in the county court should be allowed to file exceptions in the circuit court, unless for cause shown, for in this way the settlement of the case might be greatly delayed, and the purpose of fixing the time when the exceptions should be filed would be defeated. The exceptions in this case, filed in the circuit court only, had no effect on the burden of proof. To permit such a practice would defeat the plain intent of the statute. The landowners should have been adjudged the burden of proof in the circuit court just as they were in the county court. Section 526 of the Civil Code provides : "" The burden of proof in the whole action lies on the party who would be defeated if no evidence were given on either side. "" As by the judgment in the county court the damages were fixed as $ 2, 295, and as on the trial in the circuit court, if no evidence had been given, a judgment would have been entered fixing the damages at the amount fixed in the commissioners ' report, $ 1, 000, plainly the landowners would be the party who was defeated on the appeal, if no evidence had been given, for in that event the landowners would have received $ 1, 295 less than they would have received under the judgment of the county court, from which they had appealed. Clearly, therefore, the landowners would be in substance the party who would be defeated on the appeal, if no evidence had been given. In cases like this the court must look at substance not form. At the conclusion of the evidence, among other things, the court gave the jury this instruction : "" ( 2 ) The court instructs the jury that the measure of damages in this case for the taking of the property in controversy for the uses sought in the petition is the actual, fair, and reasonable market value of the land taken, as of this date, and, in addition thereto, such a sum as will reasonably compensate the defendants for the damages, if any, done to the remainder of the tract in controversy, considering the easement and use sought thereover. The entire amount of your finding, however, shall not exceed the difference between the actual market * Page 79 value of the entire tract immediately before and the market value of what is left immediately after the taking, considering the prudent construction and operation of the transmission line in question. The jury will state the value of the land actually taken and the damages, if any, to the remainder of the tract, separately. "" The proof on the trial showed that the company had entered on the land after the judgment of the county court and had cut on it 1, 382 trees from 6 to 9 inches in diameter, 777 trees from 10 to 17 inches in diameter, and 490 trees 18 or more inches in diameter. The necessary effect of the instruction was that the jury could allow nothing for this timber, for the jury were told to find the actual, fair, and reasonable market value of the land taken "" as of this date, "" the date of the trial, which was on May 3, 1927, when the judgment of the county court was entered on January 17, 1927, and all this timber had been cut from this land in the meantime. The timber growing on the land was a part of the land. To take the land was to take the timber which was growing on it and a part of it. The plaintiffs were entitled to compensation for the land in its condition at the time it was taken. Pollock v. Maysville, etc., R. R. Co., 103 Ky. 84, 44 S. W. 359, 19 Ky.

Instead of the words "" as of this date the court should have inserted these words : "" as of the date it was taken. "" The timber being a part of the land taken the property owner may show the value of the timber standing on the land, and he may also show that the land has fire clay in it or coal or any other substance giving it value ; for the value of the land depends upon such things. Anything on the land or in the land making it valuable may be shown, for, in determining the value of the land, the jury should take into consideration all the facts.

W. 1000. In the first instruction to the jury, the court, after defining the rights of the company in the strip of land taken, added these words : "" No timber is being sought on the property in question, but merely the right to cut the same where it interferes with the prudent and careful construction and operation of the line. "" This should have been omitted from the instruction. The property owner was entitled to his property as it was when it was taken under the right of eminent domain, and he was entitled under the Constitution to just compensation for the property taken. To cut the trees from the land was to take them, for they were no longer part of the land. To require the landowner to accept the cut timber and place on him the burden of taking care of it is not to give him just compensation for the taking of his property, but to place a burden on him which cannot be done under the Constitution. The cutting of the trees from the land was a conversion of the trees. In Ky. - Tenn. Light Power Co. v. Shanklin, 219 Ky. 279, 292 S. W. 790, the lower court, in the instruction defining the rights of the parties, used, in substance, these words : "" Subject to the aforesaid rights of plaintiff, the defendants have the right to cultivate and use said land and have the fee - simple title to same. "" This instruction was there approved, and on another trial the court will give an instruction in these words, and mark it "" No. 2. "" In that case the court directed the instruction on the measure of damages to be given in these words : "" You will find for the defendant such a sum in damages as you may believe from the evidence is the fair and reasonable market value of the strip of land taken for the easement, less the reasonable market value of such strip of land for use and occupancy, * Page 81 subject to the easement, as defined in instructions No. 1 and No. 2. And will further award him such direct damages, if any, as you may believe from the evidence will result to the remainder of the tract of land by reason of the condition in which it is left by the placing of the easement on the strip above described, but the total amount found shall not exceed the difference between the fair and reasonable market value of the entire farm immediately before and immediately after taking by the plaintiff of the easement, nor the amount claimed in the petition, $ 1, 400. "" In this case, as the land is not in the condition it was when taken, these words should be added after the word "" easement, "" "" at the time the land was taken, "" and the court will otherwise make instruction 2, given on the former trial, conform, in substance, with the instruction above quoted, and mark it "" No. 3. "" Ordinarily property owners who have lived for some time in the vicinity and know the property are qualified to testify to its value. Farmers generally know the value of farm land, and may testify to its value where they know how such lands are valued in the vicinity. Persons who deal in timber and so know its value from business experience may testify to its value. See Himlar Coal Co. v. Kirk, 224 Ky. 385, 6 S. W. 2d 480, and cases cited ; 11 Rawle C.

The fact that no sales have been made of such property in the vicinity because as here one company owns the fire clay rights, and does not sell anything, is only a circumstance to be considered by the jury in weighing the evidence. In Kentucky Hydro - Electric Co. v. Woodard, 216 Ky. 631, 287 S. W. 990, the court, after holding that a mere ill - defined apprehension that in the future some misfortune might come could not be considered, added this : "" But if such fears be reasonable, not ill - defined, but founded on practical experience, and if they be entertained so generally as to enter into the calculations of all who propose to buy or sell, can it logically be said that they do not depreciate the market value of the property? The property owner is to be paid for his actual damage. If he cannot sell his property at as good a figure with this line on it as he could without it by reason of reasonable fears, not speculative, but founded on experience, and entertained * Page 82 by those who wish to buy, has he not been damaged in this regard? It is no fault of his that the line has been erected. Under such assumed state of facts, his land has been depreciated on account of such fear on the part of buyers. Those who cause such damage should pay for it. "" On another trial the court will adhere to this rule in the admission of evidence on this subject. Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.",3444750,"Reversing. Appellants owned 600 acres of land in Carter county. Appellees instituted an action in the county court to condemn a right of way 100 feet wide, 9,981 feet long, across the tract, containing 22.95 acres, for its high-power electric line, under section 1599b, Kentucky Statutes, which provides that the proceedings shall be in conformity to sections 835-840, Kentucky Statutes. Commissioners were appointed, who fixed the damages at $1,000. The landowners filed exceptions to the commissioners' report in the county court, and, the case being heard before a jury, there was a verdict fixing the damages at $2,295. The landowners declined to accept the money. The company paid the amount into court and took possession of the property. Both parties then took an appeal to the circuit court. In the circuit court, the company filed exceptions to the commissioners' report on the ground that the amount allowed was excessive, and, when the case came on for trial, asked that the company be adjudged the burden of proof. The landowners objected, but the motion was sustained. The jury in the circuit court, after viewing the property, fixed the damages at $1,600. *Page 77 The circuit court entered judgment pursuant to the verdict. The landowners appeal. In Shelbyville Turnpike Co. v. L. N. R. R. Co., 51 S.W. 805 , 21 Ky. Law Rep. 548, where both the landowner and the company filed exceptions in the county court to the commissioners' report, it was held, when the case reached the circuit court, that the burden of proof rested on the company, and this was followed in Calor Oil Co. v. Franzell (Ky.) 122 S.W. 188 . But in Chicago, etc., Railroad Co. v. Rottgering, 83 S.W. 584 , 26 Ky. Law Rep. 1167, it was held that the landowner, who alone excepted to the award of damages by the commissioners, was properly allowed the burden of proof and the right to the closing argument to the jury. Sections 838-839 provide: ""At the first regular term of the county court, after the owners shall have been summoned the length of time prescribed by the Civil Code of Practice before an answer is required, it shall be the duty of the court to examine said report, and if it shall appear to be in conformity to this law, and to the extent that no exceptions have been filed thereto by either party, it shall confirm said report as against the owners not excepting. ""When exceptions shall be filed by either party, the court shall forthwith cause a jury to be impaneled to try the issues of fact made by the exceptions. . . . Either party may appeal to the circuit court, by executing bond as required in other cases, within thirty days and the appeal shall be tried de novo, upon the confirmation of the report of the commissioners by the county court, or the assessment of damages by said court, as herein provided."" The statute clearly contemplates that the exceptions shall be filed at the first regular term of the county court after the owners have been duly summoned, and that the case shall be tried by the jury on the exceptions so filed. When an appeal is taken to the circuit court, the case is tried de novo, but it is the case that was tried in the county court. Here the company filed no exceptions in the county court, and was willing to accept the report of the commissioners. For the first time it filed exceptions in the circuit court simply for the purpose of obtaining the burden of proof and the right to the concluding argument in the circuit court. The statute clearly was intended to provide an expeditious mode for settling *Page 78 the rights of the parties at the first term of the county court, after the parties were before the court. It does not contemplate that the party who makes no exception to the commissioners' report in the county court should be allowed to file exceptions in the circuit court, unless for cause shown, for in this way the settlement of the case might be greatly delayed, and the purpose of fixing the time when the exceptions should be filed would be defeated. The exceptions in this case, filed in the circuit court only, had no effect on the burden of proof. To permit such a practice would defeat the plain intent of the statute. The landowners should have been adjudged the burden of proof in the circuit court just as they were in the county court. Section 526 of the Civil Code provides: ""The burden of proof in the whole action lies on the party who would be defeated if no evidence were given on either side."" As by the judgment in the county court the damages were fixed as $2,295, and as on the trial in the circuit court, if no evidence had been given, a judgment would have been entered fixing the damages at the amount fixed in the commissioners' report, $1,000, plainly the landowners would be the party who was defeated on the appeal, if no evidence had been given, for in that event the landowners would have received $1,295 less than they would have received under the judgment of the county court, from which they had appealed. Clearly, therefore, the landowners would be in substance the party who would be defeated on the appeal, if no evidence had been given. In cases like this the court must look at substance not form. At the conclusion of the evidence, among other things, the court gave the jury this instruction: ""(2) The court instructs the jury that the measure of damages in this case for the taking of the property in controversy for the uses sought in the petition is the actual, fair, and reasonable market value of the land taken, as of this date, and, in addition thereto, such a sum as will reasonably compensate the defendants for the damages, if any, done to the remainder of the tract in controversy, considering the easement and use sought thereover. The entire amount of your finding, however, shall not exceed the difference between the actual market *Page 79 value of the entire tract immediately before and the market value of what is left immediately after the taking, considering the prudent construction and operation of the transmission line in question. The jury will state the value of the land actually taken and the damages, if any, to the remainder of the tract, separately."" The proof on the trial showed that the company had entered on the land after the judgment of the county court and had cut on it 1,382 trees from 6 to 9 inches in diameter, 777 trees from 10 to 17 inches in diameter, and 490 trees 18 or more inches in diameter. The necessary effect of the instruction was that the jury could allow nothing for this timber, for the jury were told to find the actual, fair, and reasonable market value of the land taken ""as of this date,"" the date of the trial, which was on May 3, 1927, when the judgment of the county court was entered on January 17, 1927, and all this timber had been cut from this land in the meantime. The timber growing on the land was a part of the land. To take the land was to take the timber which was growing on it and a part of it. The plaintiffs were entitled to compensation for the land in its condition at the time it was taken. Pollock v. Maysville, etc., R. R. Co., 103 Ky. 84 , 44 S.W. 359 , 19 Ky. Law Rep. 1717; Big Sandy R. Co. v. Dils, 120 Ky. 563 , 87 S.W. 310 , 27 Ky. Law Rep. 952; Calor Oil Co. v. Franzell, 128 Ky. 715 , 109 S.W. 328 , 33 Ky. Law Rep. 98, 36 L.R.A. (N.S.) 456; L. N. R. R.

Instead of the words ""as of this date the court should have inserted these words: ""as of the date it was taken."" The timber being a part of the land taken the property owner may show the value of the timber standing on the land, and he may also show that the land has fire clay in it or coal or any other substance giving it value; for the value of the land depends upon such things. Anything on the land or in the land making it valuable may be shown, for, in determining the value of the land, the jury should take into consideration all the facts. ""In condemnation proceedings, landowners should be allowed to show all facts existing before the taking which a seller would adduce in attempting to make a sale *Page 80 and all facts resulting from the taking to which a purchaser would call attention in an effort to beat down the price."" Kentucky Hydro-Electric Co. v. Reister, 216 Ky. 303 , 309 , 287 S.W. 357 , 359 . ""All of the surrounding circumstances may be taken into consideration in establishing the fair market value of a tract of land."" Chicago, St. L. N. O. Ry. Co. v. Ware, 220 Ky. 778 , 295 S.W. 1000 . In the first instruction to the jury, the court, after defining the rights of the company in the strip of land taken, added these words: ""No timber is being sought on the property in question, but merely the right to cut the same where it interferes with the prudent and careful construction and operation of the line."" This should have been omitted from the instruction. The property owner was entitled to his property as it was when it was taken under the right of eminent domain, and he was entitled under the Constitution to just compensation for the property taken. To cut the trees from the land was to take them, for they were no longer part of the land. To require the landowner to accept the cut timber and place on him the burden of taking care of it is not to give him just compensation for the taking of his property, but to place a burden on him which cannot be done under the Constitution. The cutting of the trees from the land was a conversion of the trees. In Ky.-Tenn. Light Power Co. v. Shanklin, 219 Ky. 279 , 292 S.W. 790 , the lower court, in the instruction defining the rights of the parties, used, in substance, these words: ""Subject to the aforesaid rights of plaintiff, the defendants have the right to cultivate and use said land and have the fee-simple title to same."" This instruction was there approved, and on another trial the court will give an instruction in these words, and mark it ""No. 2."" In that case the court directed the instruction on the measure of damages to be given in these words: ""You will find for the defendant such a sum in damages as you may believe from the evidence is the fair and reasonable market value of the strip of land taken for the easement, less the reasonable market value of such strip of land for use and occupancy, *Page 81 subject to the easement, as defined in instructions No. 1 and No. 2. And will further award him such direct damages, if any, as you may believe from the evidence will result to the remainder of the tract of land by reason of the condition in which it is left by the placing of the easement on the strip above described, but the total amount found shall not exceed the difference between the fair and reasonable market value of the entire farm immediately before and immediately after taking by the plaintiff of the easement, nor the amount claimed in the petition, $1,400."" In this case, as the land is not in the condition it was when taken, these words should be added after the word ""easement,"" ""at the time the land was taken,"" and the court will otherwise make instruction 2, given on the former trial, conform, in substance, with the instruction above quoted, and mark it ""No. 3."" Ordinarily property owners who have lived for some time in the vicinity and know the property are qualified to testify to its value. Farmers generally know the value of farm land, and may testify to its value where they know how such lands are valued in the vicinity. Persons who deal in timber and so know its value from business experience may testify to its value. See Himlar Coal Co. v. Kirk, 224 Ky. 385 , 6 S.W.2d 480 , and cases cited; 11 Rawle C . L. pp. 636-638. The fact that no sales have been made of such property in the vicinity because as here one company owns the fire clay rights, and does not sell anything, is only a circumstance to be considered by the jury in weighing the evidence. In Kentucky Hydro-Electric Co. v. Woodard, 216 Ky. 631 , 287 S.W. 990 , the court, after holding that a mere ill-defined apprehension that in the future some misfortune might come could not be considered, added this: ""But if such fears be reasonable, not ill-defined, but founded on practical experience, and if they be entertained so generally as to enter into the calculations of all who propose to buy or sell, can it logically be said that they do not depreciate the market value of the property?

3453925_1,3155,"Affirming. J. C. Tracy, a resident of Corbin, Ky., during the year 1922, erected a large apartment building in the city of Corbin, and in the month of August placed an order with C. M. McClung Company, a wholesale dealer of Knoxville, Tenn., to furnish the heating and plumbing materials to be used in its construction. It appears that the company estimated and fixed the price on the heating material and drew plans for its installation from the blue prints of the building and that Tracy ' s plumber made a list of plumbing material, Tracy signing and giving to the salesman a blank order for the material which was to be shipped as specifically ordered. The first specific order was dated the 19th of September. Various other orders were made from time to time during the intervening months running through December into January, and a * Page 634 large amount of correspondence ensued in which he was requesting that shipments be expedited, the building being occupied about the first of May. Trouble arose over the adjustment of accounts and in April, 1924, McClung Company sued at law for the balance due it. Later it filed an amended petition setting out a material lien which it had properly recorded and on motion the case was transferred to equity. Tracy filed an answer and counterclaim in three paragraphs, a demurrer being sustained to the first and third paragraphs, whereupon he filed an amendment to each paragraph. Demurrers were sustained to paragraphs one and three as amended and the third was dismissed, though the first was apparently treated as if the demurrer had been overruled. Evidence was taken on all questions during preparation of the pleadings, plaintiff having concluded and the defendant having taken the principal part of his evidence before the demurrer was sustained to paragraphs one and three of the answer as amended. Before submission, but after the completion of the evidence, defendant moved to transfer the action to the ordinary docket for a trial of the question of damages, and this was overruled. On final hearing the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $ 2, 909. 09, the amount of its claim, including interest after maturity of bills ; and allowed defendant $ 213. 89 on his counterclaim, to be credited on the principal judgment. It also adjudged the enforcement of the material lien on the house and lot. The defendant excepted to all adverse rulings and appeals. ( 1 ) Plaintiff pleaded that the goods it furnished amounted to $ 4, 683. 52, upon which defendant had paid $ 1, 939. 85, leaving a balance of $ 2, 743. 73, and that the accrued interest to May 20, 1923, amounted to $ 29. 80, making a total of $ 2, 773. 49, for which it prayed judgment, with interest from May 20, 1923. In its amended petition the interest was computed to April 4, 1924, aggregating $ 179. 00, and leaving a total balance of $ 2, 909. 08, for which it asked judgment from April 4, 1924. Defendant admitted the accuracy of the charges and credits, but in effect denies the interest charge and the allowance of this is assigned as error. The evidence shows that plaintiff ' s regular terms are sixty days "" with interest charged after maturity, "" and indicates that demand was made for payment prior to May 20, 1923, and it can hardly be said the judgment is not sustained by the pleadings, hence this point is not well taken. Henderson Cotton * Page 635 Mfg. Co. v. Lowell Machine Shops, 86 Ky. 668 ; Magruder v. Ericson, 146 Ky. 89 ; Supreme Lodge of K. H. v. Lapp, 25 Rep. 74 ; McKinney Dep. Bank v. Scott, 207 Ky. 340 ; Miller v. Winter, 206 Ky. 377 ; Royster v. Waller, 186 Ky. 476. ( 2 ) In the second paragraph of the answer as amended the defendant alleged that at the time he gave plaintiff the contract, two - thirds of the construction work had been done on the building ; that he informed the plaintiff ' s agent that it was to be completed by the first of December ; that the apartments were to be occupied by tenants and that he was desirous of contracting with a firm that could furnish the material as he needed it, so as to assure its completion at the date mentioned ; that the agent represented to him that the plaintiff had all of the material necessary in stock at its plant in Knoxville, which was sufficiently near for it to be furnished at once as ordered and that this was the moving consideration in the contract. Further allegations of that paragraph related to defective material and inconvenience caused workmen by delay in shipment of material, to which reference will later be made. In the third paragraph damages were sought for loss of rents between December 1st and May 1st, it being alleged that defendant could have completed the building on that date and have rented it continuously afterward at the rate of $ 550. 00 per month, but for the delay in the delivery of this material. The alleged contract was not set out in this paragraph, but the second paragraph was made a part of it by reference in these words ; "" The defendant here reiterates all the allegations of this statement to the second paragraph of this answer, set - off and counterclaim, and adopts same as an amendment to the third paragraph of the said answer, set - off and counterclaim as fully as if rewritten herein. "" A demurrer was sustained to this paragraph and defendant refusing to plead further it was dismissed, and this is relied upon as error. There is some confusion in our practice as to whether a paragraph of a pleading may be incorporated in and made a part of another paragraph by reference ; and our decisions on this question are not entirely harmonious. Sec. 113, subsection 3 of the Civil Code provides : "" If there be more than one cause of action or defense, each must be distinctly stated in a separate * Page 636 numbered paragraph ; and either, which is intended to respond to part only of an adverse pleading must show to what part it is responsible. . . . "" This section is thus construed by Mr. Newman : "" Moreover, each paragraph or separate defense must be complete in itself without reference to others. It is true that defendant need not repeat in each paragraph the same allegations where the same facts are alike applicable to several causes of action or defenses, but having averred them in one paragraph or by way of introduction to all he may refer to them in such distinct and intelligible language as to include or incorporate them into each of the paragraphs or defenses. Each of the separate paragraphs must be a sufficient defense to the cause of action which it purports to answer and the averments of one paragraph or defense cannot, it would seem, on demurrer be brought in aid of the allegations in another without appropriate reference to such other averments. "" Newman on Pleading Practice, sec. 426d. No authority is cited in support of the text, but it is in line with Day v. Clark, 1 A. K. Marshall 521, though this was written before tile code. This case is also cited as the basis of the text in 31 C. J., page 47, in which the rule is thus laid down : "" Facts which are alleged in other pleadings in the same cause may be made a part of the pleadings by expressly adopting them. Thus one defendant may adopt the answer of another defendant. An intervenor may adopt in his petition the allegations of the plaintiff ' s petition, and a defendant may adopt the allegations of plaintiff ' s petition in a supplemental cross bill. . . . "" Consistent therewith we have said : "" Each paragraph must be a sufficient defense to the cause of action which it purports to answer and the averments of one paragraph or defense cannot be brought in aid of the allegations in another without proper reference is made to such other averments. "" ( Our italics. ) Black v. Halloway, 19 Rep. 694. * Page 637 On the contrary, in Daley v. O ' Brien, 29 Rep. 811, two inconsistent paragraphs were pleaded in the petition. the court sustained a motion to elect and plaintiff elected to prosecute the cause of action set up in the second paragraph. Thereupon the court sustained a motion to strike these words from that paragraph, "" and reiterating each and all the averments of the first paragraph of the petition, "" and later sustained a general demurrer to the cause of action set up on that pleading. In sustaining the judgment of the lower court this court said : "" Nor can the plaintiff ' s complain of the ruling of court in sustaining the motion to strike from the second paragraph the words embraced in said motion, for it is a well - settled rule that while a pleading may contain as many distinct causes of action or defenses as the pleader may have, yet each paragraph must be complete in itself. The averments of one paragraph cannot be connected with or relied on in aid of another. "" Citing Black v. Halloway. It will be observed that the words italicized supra in the Halloway case were not mentioned in the Daley opinion nor in the later one of L. N. R. R. Co. v. Adams, 148 Ky. 513, in which it is said : "". . . But when a pleading properly contains as this one did more than one paragraph, each paragraph should be sufficient in itself, or in other words state a good cause of action, without reference to the other paragraph. Black v. Halloway and Daley v. O ' Brien. "" But in that case it does not appear whether there was an attempt to adopt by reference, and it can hardly be regarded as authority on this question. The Daley case being the only one to which our attention has been called, that positively denies the propriety of adoption by reference. Perhaps the court in that opinion overlooked the words that we have italicized in the Halloway opinion, as otherwise it indicates an intention to follow rather than conflict with it. At any rate the general practice in courts of this state has been to sanction pleadings of this character, and while authority may be cited from other states to the contrary we think the reasonable and logical rule to be as stated by Mr. Newman. It follows that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the third paragraph of the answer as amended. It may also be said that the defendant ' s answer and counterclaim raised common law issues that were properly * Page 638 triable by jury and the court erred in overruling his motion to transfer to the ordinary docket for trial thereof. Carter Vallandingham v. Weisenberg, 95 Ky. 135 ; Hill v. Phillips, 87 Ky. 169 ; Bush, c. v. E. K. T. T. Co., 28 Rep. 773 ; Winchester v. Watson, 169 Ky. 213 ; Scott v. Kirtley, 166 Ky. 728. Rieger v. Schulte Eicher, 151 Ky. 129, is relied upon as laying down a different principle, but as interpreted in Scott v. Kirtley, supra, it does not conflict with this view. But though the court erred in the particular named, as it appears that the evidence was fully developed on all the issues tendered, most of it being taken before the demurrer was sustained to the third paragraph of the answer and all being taken before the motion was made to transfer, we may examine this ; and if it did not warrant a submission of the issues to the jury the defendant was not prejudiced by the court ' s action and a reversal cannot be granted therefor. Sec. 756, Civil Code. In this respect defendant testifies that he made a verbal contract with plaintiff ' s agent for the material some time in August ; that the agent knew the purpose of the building which was then two - thirds constructed ; that he ( defendant ) was looking for a firm that could furnish material at once, as the building was expected to be finished and ready for occupancy December 1st ; that he so informed the salesman, who stated that plaintiff had the material in stock and would furnish it at once as ordered, and that this was a part of the consideration for the contract ; that if the material had been furnished promptly as ordered the building would have been completed at that time, and that he had applicants for leases and would have leased all of the apartments from that date on, but its completion was delayed until May 1st, and in this he is corroborated by his workmen. But whatever may have been the representations of the salesman or the verbal understanding in August, such understanding does not seem to have existed on the 29th of September when the negotiations were finally completed. It does not appear to have been mentioned in the skeleton order signed by defendant, and it appears that prior to September 19th, when defendant made his first specific order, plaintiff had learned of a mortgage on his property, and that this delayed negotiations until September 29th, when it wrote plaintiff a letter accepting his order on its regular terms and informing him that part of the material had been ordered from Chattanooga * Page 639 and would be shipped to him on arrival ; that it had sent the heating plans in, and when it heard from the engineers would arrange to send him a list of the heating material necessary for his plans. This was the final acceptance of the order and indicates the understanding of the parties at that time, clearly showing that it was not carrying the material in stock. No special circumstances are alluded to evincing a purpose to complete the building at any particular time, or fixing any particular time for delivery of material, nor does any of the orders of defendant evince such purpose, although these continued from time to time, the bath tubs for the entire building not being ordered until January 2nd, 1923. So that, omitting all the evidence of plaintiff except the conceded letter of September 29th finally accepting the contract, and considering the subsequent conduct of the parties, there is nothing in the transaction to distinguish it from ordinary sales of this character, in which the seller is required to deliver within a reasonable time, and it is not claimed that plaintiff failed to do this, hence defendant was not prejudiced by the court ' s ruling as to the third paragraph. As to the second paragraph it may be said that the court allowed practically everything claimed by defendant aside from an item of $ 40. 00 for repairing a boiler and $ 400. 00 for removing and repairing radiators, and there was not sufficient proof on these items to have authorized a submission thereof to the jury, hence defendant was not prejudiced by the order overruling the motion for an issue out of chancery. Wherefore, perceiving no error, the judgment is affirmed.",3453925,"Affirming. J.C. Tracy, a resident of Corbin, Ky., during the year 1922, erected a large apartment building in the city of Corbin, and in the month of August placed an order with C.M. McClung Company, a wholesale dealer of Knoxville, Tenn., to furnish the heating and plumbing materials to be used in its construction. It appears that the company estimated and fixed the price on the heating material and drew plans for its installation from the blue prints of the building and that Tracy's plumber made a list of plumbing material, Tracy signing and giving to the salesman a blank order for the material which was to be shipped as specifically ordered. The first specific order was dated the 19th of September. Various other orders were made from time to time during the intervening months running through December into January, and a *Page 634 large amount of correspondence ensued in which he was requesting that shipments be expedited, the building being occupied about the first of May. Trouble arose over the adjustment of accounts and in April, 1924, McClung Company sued at law for the balance due it. Later it filed an amended petition setting out a material lien which it had properly recorded and on motion the case was transferred to equity. Tracy filed an answer and counterclaim in three paragraphs, a demurrer being sustained to the first and third paragraphs, whereupon he filed an amendment to each paragraph. Demurrers were sustained to paragraphs one and three as amended and the third was dismissed, though the first was apparently treated as if the demurrer had been overruled. Evidence was taken on all questions during preparation of the pleadings, plaintiff having concluded and the defendant having taken the principal part of his evidence before the demurrer was sustained to paragraphs one and three of the answer as amended. Before submission, but after the completion of the evidence, defendant moved to transfer the action to the ordinary docket for a trial of the question of damages, and this was overruled. On final hearing the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $2,909.09, the amount of its claim, including interest after maturity of bills; and allowed defendant $213.89 on his counterclaim, to be credited on the principal judgment. It also adjudged the enforcement of the material lien on the house and lot. The defendant excepted to all adverse rulings and appeals. (1) Plaintiff pleaded that the goods it furnished amounted to $4,683.52, upon which defendant had paid $1,939.85, leaving a balance of $2,743.73, and that the accrued interest to May 20, 1923, amounted to $29.80, making a total of $2,773.49, for which it prayed judgment, with interest from May 20, 1923. In its amended petition the interest was computed to April 4, 1924, aggregating $179.00, and leaving a total balance of $2,909.08, for which it asked judgment from April 4, 1924. Defendant admitted the accuracy of the charges and credits, but in effect denies the interest charge and the allowance of this is assigned as error. The evidence shows that plaintiff's regular terms are sixty days ""with interest charged after maturity,"" and indicates that demand was made for payment prior to May 20, 1923, and it can hardly be said the judgment is not sustained by the pleadings, hence this point is not well taken.

In the third paragraph damages were sought for loss of rents between December 1st and May 1st, it being alleged that defendant could have completed the building on that date and have rented it continuously afterward at the rate of $550.00 per month, but for the delay in the delivery of this material. The alleged contract was not set out in this paragraph, but the second paragraph was made a part of it by reference in these words; ""The defendant here reiterates all the allegations of this statement to the second paragraph of this answer, set-off and counterclaim, and adopts same as an amendment to the third paragraph of the said answer, set-off and counterclaim as fully as if rewritten herein."" A demurrer was sustained to this paragraph and defendant refusing to plead further it was dismissed, and this is relied upon as error. There is some confusion in our practice as to whether a paragraph of a pleading may be incorporated in and made a part of another paragraph by reference; and our decisions on this question are not entirely harmonious. Sec. 113, subsection 3 of the Civil Code provides: ""If there be more than one cause of action or defense, each must be distinctly stated in a separate *Page 636 numbered paragraph; and either, which is intended to respond to part only of an adverse pleading must show to what part it is responsible. . . ."" This section is thus construed by Mr. Newman: ""Moreover, each paragraph or separate defense must be complete in itself without reference to others. It is true that defendant need not repeat in each paragraph the same allegations where the same facts are alike applicable to several causes of action or defenses, but having averred them in one paragraph or by way of introduction to all he may refer to them in such distinct and intelligible language as to include or incorporate them into each of the paragraphs or defenses. Each of the separate paragraphs must be a sufficient defense to the cause of action which it purports to answer and the averments of one paragraph or defense cannot, it would seem, on demurrer be brought in aid of the allegations in another without appropriate reference to such other averments."" Newman on Pleading Practice, sec. 426d. No authority is cited in support of the text, but it is in line with Day v. Clark, 1 A.K. Marshall 521, though this was written before tile code. This case is also cited as the basis of the text in 31 C. J., page 47, in which the rule is thus laid down: ""Facts which are alleged in other pleadings in the same cause may be made a part of the pleadings by expressly adopting them. Thus one defendant may adopt the answer of another defendant. An intervenor may adopt in his petition the allegations of the plaintiff's petition, and a defendant may adopt the allegations of plaintiff's petition in a supplemental cross bill. . . ."" Consistent therewith we have said: ""Each paragraph must be a sufficient defense to the cause of action which it purports to answer and the averments of one paragraph or defense cannot be brought in aid of the allegations in another without proper reference is made to such other averments. "" (Our italics.) Black v. Halloway, 19 Rep. 694. *Page 637 On the contrary, in Daley v. O'Brien, 29 Rep. 811, two inconsistent paragraphs were pleaded in the petition. the court sustained a motion to elect and plaintiff elected to prosecute the cause of action set up in the second paragraph. Thereupon the court sustained a motion to strike these words from that paragraph, ""and reiterating each and all the averments of the first paragraph of the petition,"" and later sustained a general demurrer to the cause of action set up on that pleading. In sustaining the judgment of the lower court this court said: ""Nor can the plaintiff's complain of the ruling of court in sustaining the motion to strike from the second paragraph the words embraced in said motion, for it is a well-settled rule that while a pleading may contain as many distinct causes of action or defenses as the pleader may have, yet each paragraph must be complete in itself. The averments of one paragraph cannot be connected with or relied on in aid of another."" Citing Black v. Halloway. It will be observed that the words italicized supra in the Halloway case were not mentioned in the Daley opinion nor in the later one of L. N. R. R. Co. v. Adams, 148 Ky. 513 , in which it is said: "". . . But when a pleading properly contains as this one did more than one paragraph, each paragraph should be sufficient in itself, or in other words state a good cause of action, without reference to the other paragraph. Black v. Halloway and Daley v. O'Brien."" But in that case it does not appear whether there was an attempt to adopt by reference, and it can hardly be regarded as authority on this question. The Daley case being the only one to which our attention has been called, that positively denies the propriety of adoption by reference. Perhaps the court in that opinion overlooked the words that we have italicized in the Halloway opinion, as otherwise it indicates an intention to follow rather than conflict with it. At any rate the general practice in courts of this state has been to sanction pleadings of this character, and while authority may be cited from other states to the contrary we think the reasonable and logical rule to be as stated by Mr. Newman. It follows that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the third paragraph of the answer as amended. It may also be said that the defendant's answer and counterclaim raised common law issues that were properly *Page 638 triable by jury and the court erred in overruling his motion to transfer to the ordinary docket for trial thereof. Carter Vallandingham v. Weisenberg, 95 Ky. 135 ; Hill v. Phillips, 87 Ky. 169 ; Bush, c. v. E. K. T. T. Co., 28 Rep. 773; Winchester v. Watson, 169 Ky. 213 ; Scott v. Kirtley, 166 Ky. 728 . Rieger v. Schulte Eicher, 151 Ky. 129 , is relied upon as laying down a different principle, but as interpreted in Scott v. Kirtley, supra , it does not conflict with this view. But though the court erred in the particular named, as it appears that the evidence was fully developed on all the issues tendered, most of it being taken before the demurrer was sustained to the third paragraph of the answer and all being taken before the motion was made to transfer, we may examine this; and if it did not warrant a submission of the issues to the jury the defendant was not prejudiced by the court's action and a reversal cannot be granted therefor. Sec. 756, Civil Code. In this respect defendant testifies that he made a verbal contract with plaintiff's agent for the material some time in August; that the agent knew the purpose of the building which was then two-thirds constructed; that he (defendant) was looking for a firm that could furnish material at once, as the building was expected to be finished and ready for occupancy December 1st; that he so informed the salesman, who stated that plaintiff had the material in stock and would furnish it at once as ordered, and that this was a part of the consideration for the contract; that if the material had been furnished promptly as ordered the building would have been completed at that time, and that he had applicants for leases and would have leased all of the apartments from that date on, but its completion was delayed until May 1st, and in this he is corroborated by his workmen. But whatever may have been the representations of the salesman or the verbal understanding in August, such understanding does not seem to have existed on the 29th of September when the negotiations were finally completed. It does not appear to have been mentioned in the skeleton order signed by defendant, and it appears that prior to September 19th, when defendant made his first specific order, plaintiff had learned of a mortgage on his property, and that this delayed negotiations until September 29th, when it wrote plaintiff a letter accepting his order on its regular terms and informing him that part of the material had been ordered from Chattanooga *Page 639 and would be shipped to him on arrival; that it had sent the heating plans in, and when it heard from the engineers would arrange to send him a list of the heating material necessary for his plans. This was the final acceptance of the order and indicates the understanding of the parties at that time, clearly showing that it was not carrying the material in stock. No special circumstances are alluded to evincing a purpose to complete the building at any particular time, or fixing any particular time for delivery of material, nor does any of the orders of defendant evince such purpose, although these continued from time to time, the bath tubs for the entire building not being ordered until January 2nd, 1923. So that, omitting all the evidence of plaintiff except the conceded letter of September 29th finally accepting the contract, and considering the subsequent conduct of the parties, there is nothing in the transaction to distinguish it from ordinary sales of this character, in which the seller is required to deliver within a reasonable time, and it is not claimed that plaintiff failed to do this, hence defendant was not prejudiced by the court's ruling as to the third paragraph. As to the second paragraph it may be said that the court allowed practically everything claimed by defendant aside from an item of $40.00 for repairing a boiler and $400.00 for removing and repairing radiators, and there was not sufficient proof on these items to have authorized a submission thereof to the jury, hence defendant was not prejudiced by the order overruling the motion for an issue out of chancery. Wherefore, perceiving no error, the judgment is affirmed.",gpt-4o-2024-11-20,3357,42,What legal principles guide the resolution of disputes involving material liens and contract disputes in construction projects?,What are the tax implications of selling inherited property?
5063669_1,2834,"WINTERSHEIMER, Justice. This appeal is from a decision of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the judgment of the circuit court holding that candidate Noble did not meet the required residency qualifications for the position of district judge in the Thirty - ninth Judicial District composed of Breathitt, Powell and Wolfe counties. The critical issue is whether KRS 118. 176 applies to non - partisan judicial races and whether the suit challenging the residency qualifications of Noble was brought in the right court. Three candidates were entered in the primary election of May 29, 1984, in the Thirty - ninth Judicial District for judge. Noble received 52 percent of the vote, Meagher, the incumbent, received 28 percent, and William P. Bach received the balance. Both Noble and Meagher were certified for nomination and their names were printed on the ballot for the November election. On October 4, 1984, only 32 days from the scheduled general election on November 6, Meagher filed a complaint in the Franklin Circuit Court alleging that Noble was not eligible to be a candidate for district judge because he did not possess the required residency qualifications pursuant to Section 122 of the Kentucky Constitution. After a hearing of evidence, the circuit court on October 15, found that Noble was not a resident of the district and ordered the Secretary of State to strike his name from the judicial ballot. Noble appealed to the Court of Appeals which af * 460firmed the decision of the circuit court in regard to residency. Appeal was then taken to the Supreme Court and on October 30, 1984, after accelerated briefing by both sides, Justice Roy Vance issued an opinion and order permitting the election to proceed with both names on the ballot but reserving the final determination to the full Court. This Court reverses the decision of the Court of Appeals because the Franklin Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to consider this pre - election suit. KRS 118. 176 applies to non - partisan judicial elections and it requires that a challenge to the qualifications of a judicial candidate must be brought in the county or counties which comprise the judicial district. I Meagher argues that KRS Chapter 118A governs judicial elections and that KRS 118A. 010 ( 6 ) prevents KRS 118. 176 from applying to judicial candidates. We do not agree. In 1984, the General Assembly amended and re - codified KRS 118. 176 to extend the coverage of the statute to include any candidate seeking nomination or election in a primary or general election. We interpret the amendment to apply to candidates for judicial office. Previously, the statute had applied only to a challenge of any candidate seeking a partisan nomination or election as an independent. The 1984 amendment was passed as emergency legislation because it was thought that there was no method for challenging the qualification of some candidates. Kentucky Acts 1984, Chapter 413, § 3. The amendment was clearly intended to fill that gap. KRS Chapter 118A contains no provision for challenging the qualifications of a judicial candidate and the application of KRS 118. 176 is not prohibited by the express wording of KRS 118A. 010. It is the holding of this Court that the only proper procedure for challenging the qualifications of a judicial candidate before the election is the procedure set out in KRS 118. 176. Consequently, the proper forum in which to challenge Noble ’ s qualifications would have been the circuit court of a county in which he was alleging residence in order to qualify for the office of district judge. Section 153 of the Kentucky Constitution provides that the General Assembly shall have exclusive power over elections. Section 117 states that judges shall be elected from their respective districts or circuits on a non - partisan basis as provided by law. The legislature has enacted a general law specifically dealing with challenges to a candidate. KRS 118. 176 is the statutory remedy for challenges to the qualification of a candidate. The courts of this Commonwealth have long recognized that the judicial branch has no inherent power to pass on the validity of elections or the eligibility of candidates, but only has such power as given by the General Assembly or possessed at common law through a quo warranto proceeding. See Craft v. Davidson, 189 Ky. 378, 224 S. W. 1082 ( 1920 ) ; Ratleff v. Tackett, 209 Ky. 588, 273 S. W. 441 ( 1925 ) ; Wilson v. Tye, 122 Ky. 508, 92 S. W. 295 ( 1906 ) ; Nichols v. Pennington, Ky., 118 S. W. 382 ( 1909 ) ; Francis v. Sturgill, 163 Ky. 650, 174 S. W. 753 ( 1915 ). The statutes must be strictly complied with because compliance with certain statutory steps are jurisdictional requirements. See Brock v. Saylor, 300 Ky. 471, 189 S. W. 2d 688 ( 1945 ) ; Ritchie v. Mann, Ky., 500 S. W. 2d 62 ( 1973 ). Where a statute fixes the forum in which these statutory proceedings may be brought, only such fora have jurisdiction to hear and dispose of the matter. See Gallagher v. Campbell, 267 Ky. 370, 102 S. W. 2d 340 ( 1937 ). All election disputes involve the application of particular statutes. It is a well established rule that the statutes must be strictly construed. For application of this principle involving election contests, see Dodge v. Johnson, 210 Ky. 843, 276 S. W. 984 ( 1925 ) and Prewitt v. Caudill, 250 Ky. 698, 63 S. W. 2d 954 ( 1933 ). It is important to distinguish between an election contest and a pre - election lawsuit. The only pre - * 461election suit that can be brought is by a voter prior to the primary election. Fletcher v. Wilson, Ky., 495 S. W. 787 ; Wells v. Lewis, 300 Ky. 675, 190 S. W. 2d 28 ( 1945 ). This action is technically not an election contest. Dempsey v. Stovall, Ky., 418 S. W. 2d 419 ( 1967 ), is not applicable in this situation because the jurisdiction of the Franklin Circuit Court to hear that case was never raised or considered, nor apparently did the statutes involved specify where such action should be brought. The General Assembly has provided the procedure for challenging the eligibility and qualifications of a candidate in KRS 118. 176 effective April 11, 1984. This reco - dification of the law in 1984 did not alter the application of prior case law or the purpose of the legislation. As a result of the judicial constitutional amendment adopted in 1975 by the people of this Commonwealth, our present judicial branch was organized. Responding to the electoral mandate, the General Assembly in 1976 enacted various items of legislation including KRS Chapter 118A regarding the election of judges. KRS 118A. 010 ( 6 ) provides that no provision of Chapter 118 existing on March 10, 1976, except KRS 118. 015 through. 045 shall apply to judicial elections. All other provisions of the election laws not inconsistent with this Chapter shall be applicable. KRS 118. 176 was not specifically repealed and was relied upon in cases discussed herein after 1976. As stated earlier, in 1984, the General Assembly believed it had left a gap in its 1976 program and adopted a new provision as an emergency legislation to be effective April 11, 1984, and closed an apparent gap in the law so as to provide the exclusive remedy for challenges to judicial elections. The law does not provide any opportunity to name the Board of Elections or the Secretary of State so as to create jurisdiction in the Franklin Circuit Court. The forum and the procedures have been precisely stated by the General Assembly, and the courts of this Commonwealth have been consistent in holding that such a procedure is the exclusive remedy. See Wooton v. Smith, Ky., 155 S. W. 2d 466 ( 1941 ) ; Thomas v. Lyons, Ky., 586 S. W. 2d 711 ( 1979 ). This Court in Fletcher v. Wilson, Ky., 495 S. W. 2d 787 ( 1973 ) and Fletcher v. Teater, Ky., 503 S. W. 2d 732 ( 1974 ), decided that the question of the qualifications of a candidate to appear on the ballot should be challenged before the primary election, not afterwards. Meagher was aware of the questions concerning Noble ’ s residence before the primary. She testified that she had considered a lawsuit for sometime, but the filing of such an action was not her highest priority. She also testified that she believed that if she came in third in the primary, there would be no reason to file a lawsuit. Additional Kentucky eases on this subject may be found in Burkhart v. Blanton, Ky. App., 635 S. W. 2d 328 ( 1982 ), involving a challenge to a school board candidate ; Dickey v. Bagby, Ky. App., 574 S. W. 2d 922, 923 ( 1978 ), involving the residency issue raised before the primary in a city election ; Hall v. Miller, Ky. App., 584 S. W. 2d 51 ( 1979 ), regarding the election of a mayor in a non - partisan contest. A number of older cases deal with whether it is the right of a voter or an opposing candidate to institute a pre - pri - mary challenge. The present wording of KRS 118. 176 gives that right to either person. The procedures and the policies are unchanged. The challenge to a candidate ’ s right to appear on a ballot must be lodged before the primary. Consequently, we must disagree with the opinion of the Court of Appeals that there are no time limits in making such a challenge in a proper forum. The challenge to the qualifications under KRS 118. 176 before a general election is permitted only in cases in which there was no primary. See Stewart v. Burks, Ky., 384 S. W. 2d 316 ( 1964 ), and Burke v. Stephenson, Ky., 305 S. W. 2d 926 ( 1957 ). * 462II Although the Court of Appeals determined that KRS 118. 176 applied to challenge the qualifications of a judicial candidate, it found that the strict application of the statute would result in an injustice affecting the credibility of the judicial system. It then proceeded to affirm the decision of the circuit court on the alleged merits of the dispute. We cannot agree that the circuit court was correct in applying KRS 116. 035 ( 1 ) as the correct guide to determine residency. The proper statutory standard to determine the residence of a non - partisan judicial candidate is set out in KRS 118. - 015 ( 7 ), which states that the word “ residence ” used in reference to a candidate shall mean actual residence of the candidate without regard to the residence of the spouse of the candidate. Here the trial court found against a background of divergent testimony that candidate Noble ’ s residency was outside the district. The trial court used the wrong residency statute as a measure. The judgment would be erroneous as a matter of law in that regard. A careful examination of the record, which includes more than seven hours of testimony from 38 witnesses, indicates that much of Meagher ’ s evidence was in regard to the residence of Noble ’ s wife, including her deed, voter registration and household utilities. Noble, for his part, presented evidence of his own intent to remain in Breathitt County, his motor vehicle and drivers ’ license there, his taxes and utilities, as well as his living accommodations in Jackson. The principal focus must be on the residence of the candidate as distinguished from the location of his family. It should be noted that the inclusion of the Secretary of State does not elevate this suit so as to permit jurisdiction in the Franklin Circuit Court. The Secretary of State was performing only a ministerial action in regard to certifying candidates for the ballot, and he had no interest in the suit other than proceeding under the laws as ordered by the courts. III This Court is not insensitive to or unmindful of the necessity for all elected public officials to be qualified pursuant to law for the positions they fill. It must be noted that Kentucky law provides that Meagher, as a candidate, as well as the Attorney General and the Commonwealth Attorney for the district all have standing to bring an ouster action under the usurpation statutes, KRS 415. 030, 415. 040, 415. - 050, if they have legitimate grounds to believe that Noble is holding the office of district judge without the proper qualifications. See, Wells, supra, and Friley v. Becker, 300 Ky. 749, 190 S. W. 2d 355 ( 1945 ). IV It is the holding of this Court that KRS 118. 176 applies to non - partisan judicial races. It is our further holding that challenges to the qualifications of candidates to appear on the ballot must be made before the primary election. The proper place to challenge Noble ’ s qualifications would have been the circuit court of the county in which he was alleging residence in order to qualify for judicial office. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the order of the Franklin Circuit Court is vacated. AKER, STEPHENSON, VANCE and WINTERSHEIMER, JJ., concur. STEPHENS, C. J., dissents by separate opinion in which GANT and LEIBSON, JJ., join.",5063669," WINTERSHEIMER, Justice. This appeal is from a decision of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the judgment of the circuit court holding that candidate Noble did not meet the required residency qualifications for the position of district judge in the Thirty-ninth Judicial District composed of Breathitt, Powell and Wolfe counties. The critical issue is whether KRS 118.176 applies to non-partisan judicial races and whether the suit challenging the residency qualifications of Noble was brought in the right court. Three candidates were entered in the primary election of May 29, 1984, in the Thirty-ninth Judicial District for judge. Noble received 52 percent of the vote, Meagher, the incumbent, received 28 percent, and William P. Bach received the balance. Both Noble and Meagher were certified for nomination and their names were printed on the ballot for the November election. On October 4, 1984, only 32 days from the scheduled general election on November 6, Meagher filed a complaint in the Franklin Circuit Court alleging that Noble was not eligible to be a candidate for district judge because he did not possess the required residency qualifications pursuant to Section 122 of the Kentucky Constitution. After a hearing of evidence, the circuit court on October 15, found that Noble was not a resident of the district and ordered the Secretary of State to strike his name from the judicial ballot. Noble appealed to the Court of Appeals which af*460firmed the decision of the circuit court in regard to residency. Appeal was then taken to the Supreme Court and on October 30, 1984, after accelerated briefing by both sides, Justice Roy Vance issued an opinion and order permitting the election to proceed with both names on the ballot but reserving the final determination to the full Court. This Court reverses the decision of the Court of Appeals because the Franklin Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to consider this pre-election suit. KRS 118.176 applies to non-partisan judicial elections and it requires that a challenge to the qualifications of a judicial candidate must be brought in the county or counties which comprise the judicial district. I Meagher argues that KRS Chapter 118A governs judicial elections and that KRS 118A.010(6) prevents KRS 118.176 from applying to judicial candidates. We do not agree. In 1984, the General Assembly amended and re-codified KRS 118.176 to extend the coverage of the statute to include any candidate seeking nomination or election in a primary or general election.

A number of older cases deal with whether it is the right of a voter or an opposing candidate to institute a pre-pri-mary challenge. The present wording of KRS 118.176 gives that right to either person. The procedures and the policies are unchanged. The challenge to a candidate’s right to appear on a ballot must be lodged before the primary. Consequently, we must disagree with the opinion of the Court of Appeals that there are no time limits in making such a challenge in a proper forum. The challenge to the qualifications under KRS 118.176 before a general election is permitted only in cases in which there was no primary. See Stewart v. Burks, Ky., 384 S.W.2d 316 (1964), and Burke v. Stephenson, Ky., 305 S.W.2d 926 (1957). *462II Although the Court of Appeals determined that KRS 118.176 applied to challenge the qualifications of a judicial candidate, it found that the strict application of the statute would result in an injustice affecting the credibility of the judicial system. It then proceeded to affirm the decision of the circuit court on the alleged merits of the dispute. We cannot agree that the circuit court was correct in applying KRS 116.035(1) as the correct guide to determine residency. The proper statutory standard to determine the residence of a non-partisan judicial candidate is set out in KRS 118.-015(7), which states that the word “residence” used in reference to a candidate shall mean actual residence of the candidate without regard to the residence of the spouse of the candidate. Here the trial court found against a background of divergent testimony that candidate Noble’s residency was outside the district. The trial court used the wrong residency statute as a measure. The judgment would be erroneous as a matter of law in that regard. A careful examination of the record, which includes more than seven hours of testimony from 38 witnesses, indicates that much of Meagher’s evidence was in regard to the residence of Noble’s wife, including her deed, voter registration and household utilities. Noble, for his part, presented evidence of his own intent to remain in Breathitt County, his motor vehicle and drivers’ license there, his taxes and utilities, as well as his living accommodations in Jackson. The principal focus must be on the residence of the candidate as distinguished from the location of his family. It should be noted that the inclusion of the Secretary of State does not elevate this suit so as to permit jurisdiction in the Franklin Circuit Court. The Secretary of State was performing only a ministerial action in regard to certifying candidates for the ballot, and he had no interest in the suit other than proceeding under the laws as ordered by the courts. III This Court is not insensitive to or unmindful of the necessity for all elected public officials to be qualified pursuant to law for the positions they fill. It must be noted that Kentucky law provides that Meagher, as a candidate, as well as the Attorney General and the Commonwealth Attorney for the district all have standing to bring an ouster action under the usurpation statutes, KRS 415.030, 415.040, 415.-050, if they have legitimate grounds to believe that Noble is holding the office of district judge without the proper qualifications. See, Wells, supra, and Friley v. Becker, 300 Ky. 749, 190 S.W.2d 355 (1945). IV It is the holding of this Court that KRS 118.176 applies to non-partisan judicial races. It is our further holding that challenges to the qualifications of candidates to appear on the ballot must be made before the primary election. The proper place to challenge Noble’s qualifications would have been the circuit court of the county in which he was alleging residence in order to qualify for judicial office. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the order of the Franklin Circuit Court is vacated. AKER, STEPHENSON, VANCE and WINTERSHEIMER, JJ., concur.

4891754_1,1116,"Ogden, J. Appellant brought this suit against the appellee to recover a certain mule alleged to have been unlawfully seized by the latter, and for damages for the wrongful detention of the same. The defense set up is that the animal was lawfully seized, under and by virtue of a writ of execution which issued from a justice ’ s court, to satisfy a judgment rendered in said court against the plaintiff below. A judgment having been rendered against the plaintiff in the District Court, he has appealed. It was claimed in the court below, and is insisted upon. here, that the animal seized by the appellee was exempted from seizure and forced sale by the Constitution and laws of the State, and that therefore the seizure was unlawful and void. The act of the Legislature of 1870 ( p. 127 ), passed in full conformity with the requirements of the Constitution, exempts to every family from forced sale, among other things, two horses ; and as it was clearly established on the trial below that at the time of the seizure appellant was the head of a family and had but two horses, or rather but one horse and one mule, those animals were not subject to seizure or forced sale for debt, and these facts alone should have entitled the appellant to a recovery of the animal sued for, as the mule seized by the officer was one of those two. The wisdom of the law exempting certain property from forced sale cannot now be legally called in question, * 201while it is the imperative duty of the courts to enforce that law whenever its humane provisions have been infracted. Property may be levied upon under an execution, and the officer making the levy will be protected so long as he is ignorant of the fact that the property is not subject to execution, but whenever the interposition of the powers of the court is invoked to protect the legitimate rights of a family, all exempted property may and should be restored at any time while the same is in the custody of the law. We think it was clearly established on the trial below that the animal sued for is exempted to the family of appellant from seizure or forced sale, and that the court erred in not rendering a judgment accordingly. But it may have been contended in the court below that as the statute does not specifically exempt a mule eo nomine, therefore the animal seized was subject to levy and sale for debt. We can hardly think the Legislature intended to use the word horses in that restricted sense. The object of the Legislature in passing the exemption law was manifestly to secure to each family a sure means of comfort and support, in the enjoyment of which they might feel secure. In the exemption of two horses the Legislature evidently intended to protect to a family animals to cultivate the soil, as well as to ride or drive ; and we think it would be a very illiberal construction of the legislative intent to say, that the use of the word horses, in that connection, excluded geldings, mares or mules, since all are used for the same purpose. In the case of Cobbs v. Coleman, 14 Texas, 595, it is substantially said, that statutes should be liberally construed so as to meet the objects intended to be accomplished by the Legislature, and that a horse, as used in that connection, “ was not reserved because he was a horse, but because of his useful qualities, and his almost * 202indispensable services. ” The usefulness and services of a mule are identical with that of a horse, at least so far as the exemption is concerned ; and as in common parlance the mule is hardly distinguishable from the horse, we are of the opinion that the word horses, as used in that statute, includes mules also. This view of the case must dispose of the judgment of the District Court as rendered ; and as the case will go back for another trial we deem it proper to say, the execution produced in evidence on the trial is wholly insufficient of itself to sustain the levy and seizure of the mule. In the first place, as there is no indorsement on the writ of the proper execution by the officer making the seizure, there is no evidence that the seizure had been made by virtue of that execution. Again, it is alleged by the plaintiff below that the execution was issued without a judgment to support it. This allegation threw the burden of proof upon the defendant, who would protect himself in his levy, to show, affirmatively, that there was such a judgment. But by the transcript from the justice ’ s docket he proves that no judgment was in fact rendered, and without a judgment to support the execution it is absolutely null and void, and can confer no authority upon the officer to make the levy. ( Criswell v. Ragsdale, 18 Texas, 444 ; Bailey v. Knight, 8 Texas, 61 ; and Walker v. Emerson, 20 Texas, 710. ) Indeed, under the authority of the cases cited the execution should not have been admitted in evidence until the judgment, upon which that execution had issued, had been established. We think the court erred in overruling the motion for a new trial, and the judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed, and remanded.",4891754," Ogden, J.

6815344_1,1406,"Sims, J., after making the foregoing statement, delivered the following opinion of the court : The questions presented by the assignments of error - will, so far as necessary, be passed upon in their order as - stated below. The question upon which we feel constrained to reverse the case is as follows : 1. Did the court err in giving the verbal instruction, to the jury set forth above concerning the standard by which they should be guided in endeavoring to agree on a verdict? The question must be answered in the affirmative. It is elementary that the meeting and concurrence of the several minds of all of the jurors is essential to a valid verdict. It is true, as stated in the opinion, of this court delivered by Judge Burks in the Sims Case, 134 Va. 736, 115 S. E. 382 : “ * * that the jury room is no place for pride of opinion and obstinacy, * * that it is the duty of jurors to discuss the evidence in a spirit of fairness and candor with each other and with open minds to give careful consideration to the views of their fellows, and if it can be done, without a sacrifice of conscientious convictions, agree up. on a verdict. ” But this means that the views of a minority, as well as the views of the majority of the jurors, should be given careful consideration by their fellows. The majority view should not. prevail merely because it has a majority in support of it, as the jury * 749were told, in substance, by the instruction in question. It should not prevail unless each and all of the jurors are in fact convinced that such view is supported by the evidence which has been introduced before them, and by the law. The verdict should have the assent of all of the jurors because it is considered by them to be based on the law and the evidence ; not merely because a majority of the jurors so consider it. This is the standard, and the sole standard, by which the parties affected have the right to have verdicts found. Any other standard must necessarily result in chance verdicts which can but tend to bring jury trial into discredit. As said in Goodsell v. Seeley, 46 Mich. 623, 10 N. W. 44, 41 Am. Rep. 183, “ The law contemplates that they ( the jury ) shall, by their decisions, harmonize their views if possible, but not that they shall compromise, divide and yield for the mere purpose of an agreement. The sentiment or notion which permits this tends to bring jury trial into discredit and to convert it into a lottery. It was no doubt desirable to the public and to the parties that the jurors should agree if they could do so without sacrificing what any one of them believed were the just rights of the parties ; but not otherwise. ” As said in Richardson v. Coleman, 131 Ind. 210, 29 N. E. 909, 31 Am. St. Rep. 429 : “ The law * * expects every juror to exercise his individual judgment, and that when a verdict is agreed to it will be the verdict of each individual juror. In arriving at a verdict, a juror should not indulge in any undue pride of personal opinion, and he should not be unreasonable or obstinate, and he should give due consideration to the views and opinions of other jurors, and listen to their arguments with a willingness to be convinced, and to yield to their views if induced to believe they are cor * 750reet ; but the law does not expect, nor does it tolerate, the agreement by a juror upon a verdict unless he is convinced that it is right ; in other words, unless it is his verdict — a verdict which his conscience approves, and he, under oath, after a full consideration, believes to be right. ” 2. The other questions raised by the assignments of error concern the action of the trial court in certain rulings in the admission of certain testimony ; in giving certain instructions as asked for by the Commonwealth ; and, in modifying instruction No. 1, asked for by the accused, by inserting the words “ at the store door ” after the word “ altercation ” in the tenth line of the instruction as offered as it appears in the printed record — which must be ruled upon so far as the - same questions seem likely to arise on a new trial. As none of these assignments present any novel question, we deem it sufficient to say that we find no error in the action of the court in the particulars mentioned in the preceding paragraph ; except that we think that the insertion of the words “ at the store door ” aforesaid should have been made after the word “ deceased, ” in the eighth line of the aforesaid instruction No. 1, instead of being inserted where it was, so as to ' make the meaning less unmistakable ; and except that the ruling of the court excluding testimony as to declarations of the deceased to the effect that the deceased had in fact caught the accused robbing the store may not have been as clearly expressed as might have been. Hence, if instruction No. 1 is again offered on a new trial, it should have the modification mentioned inserted at the place which we think preferable, as above stated ; and, if the question again arises, the court should not admit testimony as to declarations of the deceased to the effect that he had in fact caught the ac * 751cused robbing the store. However, if again offered on a new trial, testimony to the effect that the deceased prior to the day of the shooting made declarations charging the accused with having stolen shoes from the store will be admissible because tending to show the animus of the deceased, and who brought on the difficulty, as correctly ruled on the former trial. We will add that we do. not regard instruction No. 8, given at the request of the Commonwealth, as a model instruction ; but, as applicable to the theory of the Commonwealth based on certain evidence introduced on the former trial, it was substantially correct. 3. As the evidence was such as that, to say the least of it in favor of the accused, it left room for honest difference of opinion on the part of the jurors based on the consideration of the law and the evidence, we think that the giving of the verbal instruction above mentioned was harmful error ; and we therefore feel constrained to set aside the verdict, annul the judgment under review, and grant a new trial, which will be accordingly done.

9541671_1,7505,"Kaplan, J. The New England Home for Little Wanderers ( Home ), which had had custody of the unmarried mothers child from about the time of its birth ten months previously, filed a petition in the Probate * 632Court for Suffolk County on April 23, 1973, to dispense with the need for the mother ’ s consent to a subsequent adoption of the child. The petition was under G. L. c. 210, § 3, as amended through St. 1972, c. 800, § 2. Subsections ( b ) and ( c ) of § 3 allow a licensed child care agency to commence such a proceeding with regard to any child in its “ care or custody ” ; the court is to approve the petition if it finds that “ the best interests of the child ” will be served thereby, and in making this determination the court “ shall consider the ability, capacity, fitness and readiness of the child ’ s parents... to assume parental responsibility, and shall also consider the plan proposed by the. . . agency initiating the petition. ” 1 In this case, * 633the Home ’ s plan was to sponsor adoption of the child by a specific family. After a hearing at which the mother was represented and the facts were brought out, the probate judge granted the Home ’ s petition. The mother appeals, attacking the court ’ s application of § 3 as well as the constitutionality of that statute. The mother ’ s major argument is that, since the Home ’ s custody of the child originated in a voluntary consent given by her, and since she later changed her mind and now wishes to keep the child, the court must decide the case, not by applying the standard of “ best interests of the child ” set out in § 3, but rather by bringing in the parental “ unfitness ” test used. in suits under the guardianship laws to remove children from the custody of their parents. See G. L. c. 201, § 5. 2 In approaching the mother ’ s contentions, it will be well first to set out the facts of the case as they appear from the probate judge ’ s report of material facts ; the evidence is not reported. Finding she was pregnant, the mother entered the Crittenton Hastings House. There a social worker from the Home discussed with her possible alternatives for caring for the expected child. The mother said she planned to have the child adopted. Foster care was explained to her as an alternative which could provide time for her to make permanent plans, for the child. After the birth of the child on June 28, 1972, the mother returned to the Crittenton for a short time and while there gave written con * 634sent to the Home ’ s assuming care and custody of the child ; she had by that time met the prospective foster parents with whom the Home was to place the child. When she gave birth the mother was thirty years old and unmarried. Her mother was dead. She lived with her retired seventy - year old father and two unmarried brothers ; her father was dependent for support on social security benefits and contributions from the brothers. Her employment since leaving high school after the second year had mostly been in factories. She returned to work in August, 1972, after the baby was born, but was laid off in April, 1973 ; at the time of the Probate Court hearing in January, 1974, she was still unemployed and was receiving unemployment compensation. She had a bank account of between $ 500 and $ 1, 000, paid $ 18 a week toward the foster care of her child, had a car, and paid for the boarding of a horse which she owned. During the period between the birth of the baby and filing of the petition by the Home, the mother consulted with the Home ’ s social worker as well as with a family counselor. Her action, however, was vacillating and indecisive ; no plan emerged with any definiteness that offered a realistic means by which she could raise and care for her child. Within a month of the baby ’ s birth she seemed to reverse her previous wish and expressed a desire to keep the child. But she could only suggest • vaguely that she would have a friend care for the child or that she would go on welfare ; she had no job at the time, her father was refusing to allow her to bring the child into his household, and she had no crib or clothing for the child. About the same time she failed to show up at a meeting with the foster parents that was set to allow her to see the child as she requested. In August, by contrast, she made an unannounced visit to the child. The following month the social worker again met with her to discuss plans for the child, but although she was employed by this time her thoughts remained vague and unrealistic. Later in the fall, she had an attorney write a * 635letter to the Home saying she wished the child returned, but this was never followed up. In November she again failed to appear at a meeting arranged with the foster parents so that she could see the child ; again this was followed by an unannounced visit. She expressed unhappiness with her job to her family Counselor and mentioned she would prefer selling, perhaps cars or real estate, or working with animals. She thought of raising and selling Burmese kittens. An appointment was made for her to see a person who raised animals, but she failed to keep the appointment. By. the time of the hearing on the Home ’ s petition, she had lost her job. Her father now said he was willing to allow the baby into the household. He had thought, however, that his daughter could not cope with a baby. The mother ’ s plan as expressed at the hearing was to get a job and have her father or a babysitter care for the child. On these facts, the judge concluded that the mother “ took an unrealistic approach to her problems and never worked out a practical way to implement her plans for herself or the child. ” The judge therefore found that it was “ in the best interest of. . . [ the child ] ” to grant the petition to dispense with parental consent to adoption, so that the child could be adopted by the family the Home had selected, a young couple in their early thirties, eight years married, with another adopted child. 3 In her attack on the application of the “ best interests ” test to her case, the mother points to the fact that the Home ’ s custody of the child, the basis of the § 3 action, * 636derived from her consent to temporary foster care, and argues that once she withdrew that consent and sought her child ’ s return there was no basis for a § 3 action. She raises the possibility, if the “ best interests ” test were applied literally in cases of voluntary custody, that a family obliged by temporary adversity such as illness to place its child in foster care might then be deprived of the child against its will if the agency decided that another family could better raise the child. She argues that the Legislature could not so have intended to disregard the ties between the child and the natural parent, and that indeed it would be unconstitutional to do so. Hence she would have us conclude that § 3 ’ s “ best interests ” test can only be applied when the parent has already been deprived of custody of the child, by court action, and that in cases where custody is based on voluntary surrender the consent of the parent may be dispensed with only on a showing of parental “ unfitness ” like that required to deprive a parent of custody under the guardianship statute, G. L. c. 201, § 5. She adds the complaint that she was not fully informed of the possible consequences when she gave consent to foster care and so she denies there was a “ custody ” to satisfy § 3. Finally, there are arguments that the § 3 “ best interests ” standard is unconstitutionally vague and that it violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution, in that it improperly discriminates against the poor, who are more likely to need foster care for their children. While we find force in the mother ’ s arguments, we believe they are based essentially on a misunderstanding of the relationship between the notions of “ best interests of the child ” and parental “ unfitness. ” The mother perceives the two criteria or tests as separate and distinct, with each to be applied in certain clearly defined circumstances. We think that the relationship is more subtle, that elements of parental “ unfitness ” figure strongly in the “ best interests ” test, while elements of “ best interests of the child ” weigh in any consideration of whether a * 637parent is fit to have custody of his child. When the interconnection or overlap is appreciated, the mothers case on the present facts is seen to be unavailing. To trace the development of the standards : Adoptions by consent of the parents were recognized in the Commonwealth at least by the time of St. 1851, c. 324, which described procedures for such adoptions. Promptly afterwards came St. 1853, c. 402, which created the first exception to the rule that adoption required the consent of living parents ; it dispensed with consent where the parent was “ insane. ” In 1859, by St. 1859, c. 61, consent was made unnecessary where the parent had “ wilfully deserted and neglected to provide for the proper care and maintenance. . . for one year ” ; this was eventually codified as part of G. L. c. 210, § 3, which also specified other grounds for dispensing with parental consent, such as current imprisonment of the parent for more than three years. Chapter 593, § 1, of the Acts of 1953, codified as G. L. c. 210, § 3A, first provided for an independent proceeding, prior to adoption proceedings proper, at which it could be determined whether parental consent was to be necessary for the adoption. Its purpose was to facilitate and expedite the process of adoption of children being held in temporary foster care. See the Department of Public Welfare recommendations, 1953 House Doc. No. 118, accompanying their draft bill,. 1953 House Doc. No. 124. The proceeding could be brought by the Department of Public Welfare or any appropriate child care agency having custody of the child. But the act was silent as to the standards to be applied in deciding when consent could be dispensed with, and in Consent to Adoption of a Minor, 345 Mass. 706 ( 1963 ), this court held that, in the absence of any other indication in the statute, the conditions set out in § 3 for direct adoptions were still to be met ; specifically, the court held that a finding of parental “ unsuitability, ” without a finding of * 638wilful desertion or neglect for a year, was not an adequate basis for a decree dispensing with the parental consent. The department had evidently not intended the § 3 conditions to be read into the independent § 3A proceeding. Therefore the department immediately sponsored St. 1964, c. 425, which provided that consent could be dispensed with “ if the court finds that the best interests of the child will be served by placement for adoption ” ; the court was not to be restricted by the § 3 conditions, but was to give “ due regard to the ability, capacity and fitness of the child ’ s parents. . . and to the plans proposed by the department or other agency initiating such petition. ” This statute thus broadened the factors the court could consider in deciding whether to proceed over the parent ’ s objections ; unsuitability besides desertion or neglect was now clearly an available ground. In fact this was not a sharp or precipitate departure from the past, for our court had already begun a gradual process of developing a “ best interests ” approach to § 3 itself. 4 The last step in the evolution of the adoption laws took * 639place in 1972 with the passage of St. 1972, c. 800. 5 The same basic standard was made to apply to direct proceedings for adoption as to the independent proceeding, and the two proceedings were both brought within § 3. To the factors “ ability, capacity and fitness ” was added “ readiness... to assume parental responsibility, ” and a “ presumption ” was established that “ the best interests of the child ” would be served by dispensing with the need for parental consent when the child has been in the custody of the department or agency for more than one year ( irrespective of incidental parental visits ). 6 The revised § 3 in its entirety was made to apply only to petitions by those already having custody of the child. It will be observed from this brief history that the explicit introduction of the “ best interests ” standard into the adoption statutes was occasioned by a judicial decision disallowing parental “ unsuitability ” as the ground for dispensing with consent to adoption. In writing the statute the department and the Legislature were concerned primarily with cases where unfit parents ( although not within the categories of old § 3 ) were blocking the adoption of their children ; we do not think they meant to allow fit parents to be deprived of their children, even if they had temporarily given up custody, unless some factor such as lengthy separation and a corresponding growth in the ties between the child and the prospective adoptive parents indicated that the child would be hurt by being returned to the natural parents. * 640Nor have we found any cases where fit parents who have voluntarily given up temporary custody for appropriate reasons lost their children to adoption by reference to the “ best interests ” standard simply because another set of parents was found better qualified. We pass to the second part of our inquiry, a consideration of the law governing the transfer of custody of children under the guardianship law. By G. L. c. 201, § 1, the Probate Court may, “ if it appears necessary or convenient ” appoint guardians of minors ; by § 5 ( deriving from St. 1873, c. 367 ), the guardian may have custody of the child, though the parents are alive and do not consent, if the court finds the parents “ unfit ” to have custody. 7 In Richards v. Forrest, 278 Mass. 547, 553 ( 1932 ), our court held that “ the first and paramount duty of courts ” in passing on custody cases under that law “ is to consult the welfare of the child. ” Further, it recognized that “ certain parents might be fit to bring up one child but unfit to bring up another. ” In Stinson v. Meegan, 318 Mass. 459, 463. ( 1945 ), we added that “ the meaning of unfit ’ is not confined to the moral character or personal qualities of the parent, ” but “ embraces other * 641circumstances, ” particularly those that “ involve the welfare of the child himself. ” The injection of considerations of the child ’ s welfare here thus roughly paralleled that in the adoption situation. 8 Both Richards and Stinson, however, declined to find “ unfitness ” sufficient to deprive a parent of custody simply on the basis of a long separation of parent and child, and the growth of close ties between the child and the person seeking custody ; the cases held that some negative findings with regard to the actual fitness of the natural parents to raise the child were necessary. That the language of “ best interests ” in the cases under the guardianship statute was not rhetoric but had real significance, however, was demonstrated by Wilkins v. Wilkins, 324 Mass. 261 ( 1949 ), which weighed heavily the fact that the child loved its guardian and distrusted and had nightmares about its parents. These circumstances, together with the emotional shock to the child were it to be uprooted, and the lack of experience or aptitude of the natural parents in dealing with the child, persuaded the court that the best interests of the child would be served by granting custody to the guardian with whom the child was residing. Thus by 1970 we could write in Kauch, petitioners, 358 Mass. 327, 329 ( 1970 ), that “ [ njearly all the relevant cases have considered the best interests of the child in determining whether the parents are unfit. ” Our result, therefore, is that the tests “ best interests of the child ” in the adoption statute and “ unfitness of the parent ” in the guardianship statute reflect different degrees of emphasis on the same factors, that the tests are not separate and distinct but cognate and connected. It remains to tie the teachings of the historical development to the present case. In invoking the “ best interests of the child ” the Legislature did not intend to disregard the ties between the child and its natural * 642parent, or to threaten a satisfactory family with loss of children because by reason of temporary adversity they are placed in foster care. 9 A parent cannot be deprived unless some affirmative reason is shown for doing so such as a finding of a serious problem with that parent, or of a separation so long as to permit very strong bonds to develop between the child and the prospective adoptive parents. When such a reason appears, however, it can hardly be argued that the Legislature is powerless to interfere with the parent - child relationship to promote the welfare of the child. Its power to do so — and this includes the power to act without perfect wisdom — was settled at least by the time of Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158 ( 1944 ) ( State may prohibit parent ’ s use of child to sell religious pamphlets ). See also Commonwealth v. Brasher, 359 Mass. 550 ( 1971 ) ( State may try minors for crime of being “ stubborn children ” ). As to the technical argument that once the mother withdrew her consent to custody there was no basis for a § 3 action, we note, first, that there is nothing in the statute to suggest that custody means anything other than physical custody, whatever the original basis for it. If it be argued that this opens the way to adoptions over the objections of parents from whom custody is being wrongfully withheld, the response is that the present is not such a case. The mother indeed now opposes the petition, but that in itself cannot amount to an effective withdrawal of consent to custody ; if it were, most of the field of action of § 3 would disappear, since it would become inapplica * 643ble except when the parent had already permanently lost custody by court action finding the parent unfit. Rather, if parental opposition to custody is by itself ever to constitute an effective bar to prosecution of a § 3 proceeding, a question we need not now decide, it must at least be consistently and vigorously pressed before the proceeding is brought. On the record before us, such opposition was not and cannot be found in the vacillating behavior of the mother over the ten - month period between the child ’ s birth and the bringing of this petition, when added to her failure and indeed her inability to take positive action toward creating an environment in which a child could be placed with any substantial hope of future stability or happiness. 10 In the absence of such opposition, the “ best interests ” standard properly applied. As to the claim of lack of comprehension on the mother ’ s part of the possible legal consequences of placing her child in foster care, with possible resulting undermining of the basis of the § 3 proceeding, we of course agree that it is desirable to inform a parent of the full meaning of a decision to place a child in foster care, and, * 644further, to explain the possible alternatives, including, for example, use of day care facilities. But if there was any shortcoming here, it was not critical. In our view, the basis of the decree dispensing with parental consent here was not simply the initial voluntary placement, but the failure, over a ten - month period, to take effective steps to demonstrate either a consistent desire for custody or an ability to care properly for the child if given custody. Had the mother, upon her initial change of heart in July, acted consistently in seeking to regain her child and planning effectively for it, we think she would and should have prevailed in any proceeding brought by the department to dispense with her consent to adoption, despite her signed agreement placing the child in temporary foster care, and regardless of the comparative qualifications of an alternative family. 11 Our conclusion is that a § 3 proceeding was appropriate in this case, and the result correct. As we have suggested, the “ best interests ” standard of § 3 is a flexible one ; the weight to be accorded the several considerations under it will vary with the circumstances. The decision * 645in the present case was not an easy one. Here parent and child had been separated for only ten months when the proceeding was brought ; this period was too short to be a decisive factor, particularly as the record does not state that the. foster parents are also to be the adoptive parents. 12 We find most significant, however, the judge ’ s conclusion that the mother “ took an unrealistic approach to her problems and never worked out a practical way to implement her plans for herself or the child. ” The trial judge had the opportunity to observe the parties close up, and her findings are entitled to much respect. See Guardianship of a Minor, 1 Mass. App. Ct. 392 ( 1973 ). 13 In the circumstances we do not think the result would be any different had the analysis been conducted in the language of the “ unfitness ” standard, as the mother urges it should have been. In reaching our conclusion to support the judge ’ s finding we wish to point out with emphasis that we do not lend any approval to dispensing with parental consent for other than substantial reasons. The attitude to be taken by the department, the agencies, and the courts as well, was defined by the Legislature in G. L. c. 119, § 1, which declares it “ to be the policy of this commonwealth to direct its efforts, first, to the strengthening and encouragement of family life for the protection and care of children ; to assist and encourage the use by any family of all available resources to this end ; and to provide substitute care of children only when the family itself or the * 646resources available to the family are unable to provide the necessary care and protection. ” Thus parents should be given ample opportunity to demonstrate an ability to provide proper care for their children before a § 3 proceeding is brought. Precipitate attempts to force adoption over parental objection simply because foster care has occurred are not consistent with the law and must be avoided. It is a condition of dispensing with parental consent that the parents be shown to have grievous shortcomings or handicaps that would put the child ’ s welfare in the family milieu much at hazard. On the constitutional plane, we see no merit in the argument that the “ best interests ” standard is overly vague. Section 3 itself sets out factors to be taken into account in deciding if the standard is met. Moreover, as we have indicated in this opinion, the course of the legislative development of the standard and the associated case law provide further definition. Standards of mathematical precision are neither possible nor desirable in this field ; much must be left to the trial judge ’ s experience and judgment. Underlying each case are predictions as to the possible future development of a child, and these are beyond truly accurate forecast. In similar situations statutes with unavoidable penumbras of indefiniteness have been upheld, and we think this one, too, is valid. See Commonwealth v. Brasher, 359 Mass. 550 ( 1974 ) ( “ stubborn child ” ) ; A Juvenile, petitioner, 364 Mass. 531 ( 1974 ) ( statute allowing trial of juvenile if “ the interests of the public ” require it ) ; Guardianship of a Minor, 1 Mass. App. Ct. 392 ( 1973 ) ( “ unfitness ” in guardianship custody statute ). Nor do we find a violation of the equal protection clause. If the argument be made that under § 3 State interposition in the parent - child relationship will occur more frequently in poor families than in wealthy ones, we can say no more than that the statute ’ s classification is not directly based on wealth, and a differential effect in practice on families with varying incomes occurs also * 647with many valid laws. The overriding constitutional basis for the law is the State ’ s interest in protecting those children found on a reasonable basis to be in need of adoption. Decree affirmed. “ Section 3. ( a ) Whenever a petition for adoption is filed by a person having the care or custody of a child, the consent of the. . . [ parents ] shall not be required if : —... ( ii ) the court hearing the petition finds that the allowance of the petition is in the best interests of the child, as defined in paragraph ( c ). ( b ) The department of public welfare or any licensed child care agency may commence a proceeding, independent of a petition for adoption, in the probate court... to dispense with the need for consent of. . . [ a parent ] to the adoption of a child in the care or custody of said department or agency. . . . The court shall issue a decree dispensing with the need for said consent. . . for adoption of such child subsequently sponsored by said department or agency if it finds that the best interests of the child as defined in paragraph ( c ) will be served by said decree. ... ( c ) In determining whether the best interests of the child will be served by granting a petition for adoption without requiring certain consent as permitted under paragraph ( a ), the court shall consider the ability, capacity, fitness and readiness of the child ’ s parents... to assume parental responsibility and shall also consider the ability, capacity, fitness and readiness of the petitioners under paragraph ( a ) to assume such responsibilities. In determining whether the best interests of the child will be served by issuing a decree dispensing with the need of consent as permitted under paragraph ( b ), the court shall consider the ability, capacity, fitness and readiness of the child ’ s parents... to assume parental responsibility, and shall also consider the plan proposed by the department or other agency initiating the petition. If said child has been in the care of the department or a licensed child care agency for more than one year, in each case irrespective of incidental communications or visits from his parents. . . there shall be a presumption that the best interests of the child will be served by granting a petition for * 633adoption as permitted under paragraph ( a ) or by issuing a decree dispensing with the need for consent as permitted under paragraph ( by “ Section 5. ... The probate court may, upon the written consent of the parents or surviving parent, order that the guardian shall have. . . custody ; and may so order if, upon a hearing and after such notice to the parents or surviving parent as it may order, it finds such parents, jointly, or the surviving parent, unfit to have such custody ; or if it finds one of them unfit to have such custody ; or if it finds one of them unfit therefor and the other files in court his or her written consent to such order. ... ” An investigation of the background of that family had furnished convincing evidence that they were suitable as adoptive parents. The decree itself of course did not consummate the adoption., A fresh petition in the Probate Court for adoption under G. L. c. 210, § 1, remains necessary, see also § 5A ( requiring report by Department of Public Welfare or adoption agency on chüd and adoptive parents ), but the § 2 requirement for parental consent was eliminated by the proceeding ^ here in question, thus making the petition for adoption a simple proceeding. For example, in Adoption of a Minor, 343 Mass. 292 ( 1961 ), an aunt who had had custody of a child since a week after birth petitioned to adopt the child despite the objections of the mother. Though the mother was worthy to be a parent, we said expressly that the successive amendments of § 3 disclosed “ a clear intent on the part of the Legislature to relax the requirement of parental consent to adoption when the withholding of consent by a neglectful parent would frustrate the furtherance of the best interests of the child. ” Id. at 298. We accordingly took into account the bad effect on the child of breaking the bonds of affection between the aunt and the child, and approved the aunt ’ s adoption of the child. See Adoption of a Minor, 357 Mass. 490, 492 ( 1970 ) ; Adoption of a Minor, 362 Mass. 882 ( 1972 ). See also Adoption of a Minor, 338 Mass. 635 ( 1959 ) ( applying “ best interests ” test to dispute over whether consent to adoption was necessary by unmarried father of child who later married mother ) ; Erickson v. Raspperry, 320 Mass. 333 ( 1946 ) ( applying “ best interests ” test to decide whether consent to adoption could be revoked ). This 1972 legislation was part of a larger program of reform developed by the Governor ’ s Commission on Adoption and Foster Care which included the creation of an Office for Children. See the Governor ’ s message of February 9, 1972, House Doc. No. 5131. Also to be consulted is Professor Gruber ’ s influential later report to the Commission, Foster Home Care in Massachusetts ( 1973 ), as well as the Commission ’ s report, Governor ’ s Commission on Adoption and Foster Care, Report to Governor Sargent, March 14, 1973. The “ presumption ” was not relied on by the probate judge in her report in the present case and does not figure on this appeal. Alternatively, G. L. c. 119, § 23 ( C ), as appearing in St. 1970, c. 888, § 5, permits the Department of Public Welfare to “ seek and. . . accept ” on order of the Probate Court “ responsibility ” for minors “ without proper guardianship due to the death, unavailability, incapacity or unfitness of the parent. ” Such responsibility may, if the court orders, include the right to consent to adoption. Sections 24 - 26 allow a Juvenile Court ( or the juvenile session of a District Court where there is no Juvenile Court ) if it finds after petition by “ any person ” that a child is “ without necessary and proper physical, educational or moral care and discipline, or is growing up under conditions or circumstances damaging to a child ’ s sound character development, or. . . lacks proper attention of parent. . . and whose parents. . . are unwilling, incompetent or unavailable to provide such care, ” to commit the child to the custody of the department or “ make any other appropriate order with reference to the care and custody of the child as may conduce to his best interests, including but not limited to ” leaving the child with its parents under supervision, or transferring temporary custody to a qualified individual, agency, or the Department of Public Welfare. See n. 4 above. We are not drawn into the long standing debate among psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and lawyers about the precise limits of the claims of “ biological ” parents or about the precise values of “ continuity ” in the care of children. For the current phase, see Goldstein, Freud & Solnit, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child ( 1973 ), and reviews by Dembitz, 83 Yale L. J. 1304 ( 1974 ) ; Katkin, Bullington & Levine, 8 Law & Soc. Rev. 669 ( 1974 ) ; Rothman & Rothman, 1 The Civ. Lib. Rev. 110 ( 1974 ). See also Mnookin, Foster Care — In Whose Best Interest? 43 Harv. Educ. Rev. 599 ( 1973 ). In White v. Minter, 330 F. Supp. 1194 ( D. Mass. 1971 ), a three judge Federal court held that the G. L. c. 248, § § 35 - 40, action by which a parent may seek to regain custody of a child was not adequate to protect a mother ’ s rights. The G. L. c. 248 action amounts to a “ habeas corpus "" proceeding on behalf of a minor by its parent against those wrongfully hólding the child. In the White case, the Department of Public Welfare had obtained custody on a voluntary basis during a temporary illness, and the mother had sought to regain the child as soon as she was able to, within three weeks of the placement, and had continued to seek its return. The department, however, neither returned the child nor instituted an action under G. L. c. 119, § 23 ( see n. 7 above ), letting six months pass. In the circumstances, which are far from those of the present case, the court ruled that the mother ’ s rights had been violated. It held that the department must either return the child or bring suit for custody itself, finding the G. L. c. 248 action an inadequate remedy for the mother because under it, the court said, she had the “ burden of proof. ” Cf. Boyns v. Department of Pub. Welfare, 360 Mass. 600 ( 1971 ). In Stinson v. Meegan, 318 Mass. 459, 462 ( 1945 ), we had held that the issue in a G. L. c. 248 action was exactly that in a * 644guardianship custody proceeding under G. L. c. 201, § 5 : was the parent “ unfit ”? We think the basis of White, therefore, is less one of technical “ burden of proof ” than of imposition on the mother of the burden of instituting and prosecuting a lawsuit. In any event, White does not apply here. The mother here did not consistently seek the return of the child after she gave it up, and act toward that end. Moreover, it is likely here that the agency refrained from pressing any action against the mother in order to give her time to arrange her affairs and make plans to take the child back if she wished and was able to do so. It may well have felt that an earlier action would be premature because the mother had not yet demonstrated her unfitness, and because the child was still so young that the transfer back to its mother, if she were able and willing to assume responsibility, would not cause a profound shock to it. See 645 - 646 below. Compare the situation in Adoption of a Minor, 362 Mass. 842 ( 1973 ), in which the signed agreement was for adoption, and we held it therefore directly satisfied the G. L. c. 210, § 2, requirement of parental consent. Here no such consent was given, so a § 3 “ best interests ” inquiry was necessary in any event regardless of her consent to foster care. We do note, however, that in many cases foster parents are now being sponsored as adoptive parents ; especially if the foster care has been extended, the putative emotional shock to the child of transfer may be an important factor in the calculus. As we have a report of material facts with the evidence not reported, “ [ t ] he facts found by the probate judge must be accepted as true. Richards v. Forrest, 278 Mass. 547, 551 - 552 [ 1932 ]. The sole question is ‘ whether the findings of the judge “ should in law require a decree different from that which was entered in the. . . [ court below ]. ” ’ Cosgrove v. Cosgrove, 351 Mass. 64, 66 [ 1966 ]. ” Kauch, petitioners, 358 Mass. 327, 328 ( 1970 ).",9541671," Kaplan, J. The New England Home for Little Wanderers (Home), which had had custody of the unmarried mothers child from about the time of its birth ten months previously, filed a petition in the Probate *632Court for Suffolk County on April 23, 1973, to dispense with the need for the mother’s consent to a subsequent adoption of the child. The petition was under G. L. c. 210, § 3, as amended through St. 1972, c. 800, § 2. Subsections (b) and (c) of § 3 allow a licensed child care agency to commence such a proceeding with regard to any child in its “care or custody”; the court is to approve the petition if it finds that “the best interests of the child” will be served thereby, and in making this determination the court “shall consider the ability, capacity, fitness and readiness of the child’s parents ... to assume parental responsibility, and shall also consider the plan proposed by the . . . agency initiating the petition.”1 In this case, *633the Home’s plan was to sponsor adoption of the child by a specific family. After a hearing at which the mother was represented and the facts were brought out, the probate judge granted the Home’s petition. The mother appeals, attacking the court’s application of § 3 as well as the constitutionality of that statute. The mother’s major argument is that, since the Home’s custody of the child originated in a voluntary consent given by her, and since she later changed her mind and now wishes to keep the child, the court must decide the case, not by applying the standard of “best interests of the child” set out in § 3, but rather by bringing in the parental “unfitness” test used.in suits under the guardianship laws to remove children from the custody of their parents. See G. L. c. 201, § 5.2 In approaching the mother’s contentions, it will be well first to set out the facts of the case as they appear from the probate judge’s report of material facts; the evidence is not reported. Finding she was pregnant, the mother entered the Crittenton Hastings House. There a social worker from the Home discussed with her possible alternatives for caring for the expected child. The mother said she planned to have the child adopted. Foster care was explained to her as an alternative which could provide time for her to make permanent plans,for the child. After the birth of the child on June 28, 1972, the mother returned to the Crittenton for a short time and while there gave written con*634sent to the Home’s assuming care and custody of the child; she had by that time met the prospective foster parents with whom the Home was to place the child. When she gave birth the mother was thirty years old and unmarried. Her mother was dead. She lived with her retired seventy-year old father and two unmarried brothers; her father was dependent for support on social security benefits and contributions from the brothers. Her employment since leaving high school after the second year had mostly been in factories. She returned to work in August, 1972, after the baby was born, but was laid off in April, 1973; at the time of the Probate Court hearing in January, 1974, she was still unemployed and was receiving unemployment compensation. She had a bank account of between $500 and $1,000, paid $18 a week toward the foster care of her child, had a car, and paid for the boarding of a horse which she owned. During the period between the birth of the baby and filing of the petition by the Home, the mother consulted with the Home’s social worker as well as with a family counselor. Her action, however, was vacillating and indecisive; no plan emerged with any definiteness that offered a realistic means by which she could raise and care for her child. Within a month of the baby’s birth she seemed to reverse her previous wish and expressed a desire to keep the child. But she could only suggest •vaguely that she would have a friend care for the child or that she would go on welfare; she had no job at the time, her father was refusing to allow her to bring the child into his household, and she had no crib or clothing for the child. About the same time she failed to show up at a meeting with the foster parents that was set to allow her to see the child as she requested. In August, by contrast, she made an unannounced visit to the child. The following month the social worker again met with her to discuss plans for the child, but although she was employed by this time her thoughts remained vague and unrealistic. Later in the fall, she had an attorney write a *635letter to the Home saying she wished the child returned, but this was never followed up. In November she again failed to appear at a meeting arranged with the foster parents so that she could see the child; again this was followed by an unannounced visit. She expressed unhappiness with her job to her family Counselor and mentioned she would prefer selling, perhaps cars or real estate, or working with animals. She thought of raising and selling Burmese kittens. An appointment was made for her to see a person who raised animals, but she failed to keep the appointment. By .the time of the hearing on the Home’s petition, she had lost her job. Her father now said he was willing to allow the baby into the household. He had thought, however, that his daughter could not cope with a baby. The mother’s plan as expressed at the hearing was to get a job and have her father or a babysitter care for the child. On these facts, the judge concluded that the mother “took an unrealistic approach to her problems and never worked out a practical way to implement her plans for herself or the child.” The judge therefore found that it was “in the best interest of . . . [the child]” to grant the petition to dispense with parental consent to adoption, so that the child could be adopted by the family the Home had selected, a young couple in their early thirties, eight years married, with another adopted child.3 In her attack on the application of the “best interests” test to her case, the mother points to the fact that the Home’s custody of the child, the basis of the § 3 action, *636derived from her consent to temporary foster care, and argues that once she withdrew that consent and sought her child’s return there was no basis for a § 3 action. She raises the possibility, if the “best interests” test were applied literally in cases of voluntary custody, that a family obliged by temporary adversity such as illness to place its child in foster care might then be deprived of the child against its will if the agency decided that another family could better raise the child. She argues that the Legislature could not so have intended to disregard the ties between the child and the natural parent, and that indeed it would be unconstitutional to do so. Hence she would have us conclude that § 3’s “best interests” test can only be applied when the parent has already been deprived of custody of the child, by court action, and that in cases where custody is based on voluntary surrender the consent of the parent may be dispensed with only on a showing of parental “unfitness” like that required to deprive a parent of custody under the guardianship statute, G. L. c. 201, § 5. She adds the complaint that she was not fully informed of the possible consequences when she gave consent to foster care and so she denies there was a “custody” to satisfy § 3. Finally, there are arguments that the § 3 “best interests” standard is unconstitutionally vague and that it violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution, in that it improperly discriminates against the poor, who are more likely to need foster care for their children. While we find force in the mother’s arguments, we believe they are based essentially on a misunderstanding of the relationship between the notions of “best interests of the child” and parental “unfitness.” The mother perceives the two criteria or tests as separate and distinct, with each to be applied in certain clearly defined circumstances. We think that the relationship is more subtle, that elements of parental “unfitness” figure strongly in the “best interests” test, while elements of “best interests of the child” weigh in any consideration of whether a *637parent is fit to have custody of his child. When the interconnection or overlap is appreciated, the mothers case on the present facts is seen to be unavailing. To trace the development of the standards: Adoptions by consent of the parents were recognized in the Commonwealth at least by the time of St. 1851, c. 324, which described procedures for such adoptions. Promptly afterwards came St. 1853, c. 402, which created the first exception to the rule that adoption required the consent of living parents; it dispensed with consent where the parent was “insane.” In 1859, by St. 1859, c. 61, consent was made unnecessary where the parent had “wilfully deserted and neglected to provide for the proper care and maintenance . . . for one year”; this was eventually codified as part of G. L. c. 210, § 3, which also specified other grounds for dispensing with parental consent, such as current imprisonment of the parent for more than three years. Chapter 593, § 1, of the Acts of 1953, codified as G. L. c. 210, § 3A, first provided for an independent proceeding, prior to adoption proceedings proper, at which it could be determined whether parental consent was to be necessary for the adoption. Its purpose was to facilitate and expedite the process of adoption of children being held in temporary foster care. See the Department of Public Welfare recommendations, 1953 House Doc. No. 118, accompanying their draft bill,. 1953 House Doc. No. 124. The proceeding could be brought by the Department of Public Welfare or any appropriate child care agency having custody of the child. But the act was silent as to the standards to be applied in deciding when consent could be dispensed with, and in Consent to Adoption of a Minor, 345 Mass. 706 (1963), this court held that, in the absence of any other indication in the statute, the conditions set out in § 3 for direct adoptions were still to be met; specifically, the court held that a finding of parental “unsuitability,” without a finding of *638wilful desertion or neglect for a year, was not an adequate basis for a decree dispensing with the parental consent. The department had evidently not intended the § 3 conditions to be read into the independent § 3A proceeding. Therefore the department immediately sponsored St. 1964, c. 425, which provided that consent could be dispensed with “if the court finds that the best interests of the child will be served by placement for adoption”; the court was not to be restricted by the § 3 conditions, but was to give “due regard to the ability, capacity and fitness of the child’s parents . . . and to the plans proposed by the department or other agency initiating such petition.” This statute thus broadened the factors the court could consider in deciding whether to proceed over the parent’s objections; unsuitability besides desertion or neglect was now clearly an available ground. In fact this was not a sharp or precipitate departure from the past, for our court had already begun a gradual process of developing a “best interests” approach to § 3 itself.4 The last step in the evolution of the adoption laws took *639place in 1972 with the passage of St. 1972, c. 800.5 The same basic standard was made to apply to direct proceedings for adoption as to the independent proceeding, and the two proceedings were both brought within § 3. To the factors “ability, capacity and fitness” was added “readiness ... to assume parental responsibility,” and a “presumption” was established that “the best interests of the child” would be served by dispensing with the need for parental consent when the child has been in the custody of the department or agency for more than one year (irrespective of incidental parental visits).6 The revised § 3 in its entirety was made to apply only to petitions by those already having custody of the child. It will be observed from this brief history that the explicit introduction of the “best interests” standard into the adoption statutes was occasioned by a judicial decision disallowing parental “unsuitability” as the ground for dispensing with consent to adoption. In writing the statute the department and the Legislature were concerned primarily with cases where unfit parents (although not within the categories of old § 3) were blocking the adoption of their children; we do not think they meant to allow fit parents to be deprived of their children, even if they had temporarily given up custody, unless some factor such as lengthy separation and a corresponding growth in the ties between the child and the prospective adoptive parents indicated that the child would be hurt by being returned to the natural parents. *640Nor have we found any cases where fit parents who have voluntarily given up temporary custody for appropriate reasons lost their children to adoption by reference to the “best interests” standard simply because another set of parents was found better qualified. We pass to the second part of our inquiry, a consideration of the law governing the transfer of custody of children under the guardianship law. By G. L. c. 201, § 1, the Probate Court may, “if it appears necessary or convenient” appoint guardians of minors; by § 5 (deriving from St. 1873, c. 367), the guardian may have custody of the child, though the parents are alive and do not consent, if the court finds the parents “unfit” to have custody.7 In Richards v. Forrest, 278 Mass. 547, 553 (1932), our court held that “the first and paramount duty of courts” in passing on custody cases under that law “is to consult the welfare of the child.” Further, it recognized that “certain parents might be fit to bring up one child but unfit to bring up another.” In Stinson v. Meegan, 318 Mass. 459, 463. (1945), we added that “the meaning of unfit’ is not confined to the moral character or personal qualities of the parent,” but “embraces other *641circumstances,” particularly those that “involve the welfare of the child himself.” The injection of considerations of the child’s welfare here thus roughly paralleled that in the adoption situation.8 Both Richards and Stinson, however, declined to find “unfitness” sufficient to deprive a parent of custody simply on the basis of a long separation of parent and child, and the growth of close ties between the child and the person seeking custody; the cases held that some negative findings with regard to the actual fitness of the natural parents to raise the child were necessary. That the language of “best interests” in the cases under the guardianship statute was not rhetoric but had real significance, however, was demonstrated by Wilkins v. Wilkins, 324 Mass. 261 (1949), which weighed heavily the fact that the child loved its guardian and distrusted and had nightmares about its parents. These circumstances, together with the emotional shock to the child were it to be uprooted, and the lack of experience or aptitude of the natural parents in dealing with the child, persuaded the court that the best interests of the child would be served by granting custody to the guardian with whom the child was residing. Thus by 1970 we could write in Kauch, petitioners, 358 Mass. 327, 329 (1970), that “ [njearly all the relevant cases have considered the best interests of the child in determining whether the parents are unfit.” Our result, therefore, is that the tests “best interests of the child” in the adoption statute and “unfitness of the parent” in the guardianship statute reflect different degrees of emphasis on the same factors, that the tests are not separate and distinct but cognate and connected. It remains to tie the teachings of the historical development to the present case. In invoking the “best interests of the child” the Legislature did not intend to disregard the ties between the child and its natural *642parent, or to threaten a satisfactory family with loss of children because by reason of temporary adversity they are placed in foster care.9 A parent cannot be deprived unless some affirmative reason is shown for doing so such as a finding of a serious problem with that parent, or of a separation so long as to permit very strong bonds to develop between the child and the prospective adoptive parents. When such a reason appears, however, it can hardly be argued that the Legislature is powerless to interfere with the parent-child relationship to promote the welfare of the child. Its power to do so — and this includes the power to act without perfect wisdom — was settled at least by the time of Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158 (1944) (State may prohibit parent’s use of child to sell religious pamphlets). See also Commonwealth v. Brasher, 359 Mass. 550 (1971) (State may try minors for crime of being “stubborn children”). As to the technical argument that once the mother withdrew her consent to custody there was no basis for a § 3 action, we note, first, that there is nothing in the statute to suggest that custody means anything other than physical custody, whatever the original basis for it. If it be argued that this opens the way to adoptions over the objections of parents from whom custody is being wrongfully withheld, the response is that the present is not such a case. The mother indeed now opposes the petition, but that in itself cannot amount to an effective withdrawal of consent to custody; if it were, most of the field of action of § 3 would disappear, since it would become inapplica*643ble except when the parent had already permanently lost custody by court action finding the parent unfit. Rather, if parental opposition to custody is by itself ever to constitute an effective bar to prosecution of a § 3 proceeding, a question we need not now decide, it must at least be consistently and vigorously pressed before the proceeding is brought. On the record before us, such opposition was not and cannot be found in the vacillating behavior of the mother over the ten-month period between the child’s birth and the bringing of this petition, when added to her failure and indeed her inability to take positive action toward creating an environment in which a child could be placed with any substantial hope of future stability or happiness.10 In the absence of such opposition, the “best interests” standard properly applied. As to the claim of lack of comprehension on the mother’s part of the possible legal consequences of placing her child in foster care, with possible resulting undermining of the basis of the § 3 proceeding, we of course agree that it is desirable to inform a parent of the full meaning of a decision to place a child in foster care, and, *644further, to explain the possible alternatives, including, for example, use of day care facilities. But if there was any shortcoming here, it was not critical. In our view, the basis of the decree dispensing with parental consent here was not simply the initial voluntary placement, but the failure, over a ten-month period, to take effective steps to demonstrate either a consistent desire for custody or an ability to care properly for the child if given custody. Had the mother, upon her initial change of heart in July, acted consistently in seeking to regain her child and planning effectively for it, we think she would and should have prevailed in any proceeding brought by the department to dispense with her consent to adoption, despite her signed agreement placing the child in temporary foster care, and regardless of the comparative qualifications of an alternative family.11 Our conclusion is that a § 3 proceeding was appropriate in this case, and the result correct. As we have suggested, the “best interests” standard of § 3 is a flexible one; the weight to be accorded the several considerations under it will vary with the circumstances. The decision *645in the present case was not an easy one. Here parent and child had been separated for only ten months when the proceeding was brought; this period was too short to be a decisive factor, particularly as the record does not state that the. foster parents are also to be the adoptive parents.12 We find most significant, however, the judge’s conclusion that the mother “took an unrealistic approach to her problems and never worked out a practical way to implement her plans for herself or the child.” The trial judge had the opportunity to observe the parties close up, and her findings are entitled to much respect. See Guardianship of a Minor, 1 Mass. App. Ct. 392 (1973).13 In the circumstances we do not think the result would be any different had the analysis been conducted in the language of the “unfitness” standard, as the mother urges it should have been. In reaching our conclusion to support the judge’s finding we wish to point out with emphasis that we do not lend any approval to dispensing with parental consent for other than substantial reasons. The attitude to be taken by the department, the agencies, and the courts as well, was defined by the Legislature in G. L. c. 119, § 1, which declares it “to be the policy of this commonwealth to direct its efforts, first, to the strengthening and encouragement of family life for the protection and care of children; to assist and encourage the use by any family of all available resources to this end; and to provide substitute care of children only when the family itself or the *646resources available to the family are unable to provide the necessary care and protection.” Thus parents should be given ample opportunity to demonstrate an ability to provide proper care for their children before a § 3 proceeding is brought. Precipitate attempts to force adoption over parental objection simply because foster care has occurred are not consistent with the law and must be avoided. It is a condition of dispensing with parental consent that the parents be shown to have grievous shortcomings or handicaps that would put the child’s welfare in the family milieu much at hazard. On the constitutional plane, we see no merit in the argument that the “best interests” standard is overly vague. Section 3 itself sets out factors to be taken into account in deciding if the standard is met. Moreover, as we have indicated in this opinion, the course of the legislative development of the standard and the associated case law provide further definition. Standards of mathematical precision are neither possible nor desirable in this field; much must be left to the trial judge’s experience and judgment. Underlying each case are predictions as to the possible future development of a child, and these are beyond truly accurate forecast. In similar situations statutes with unavoidable penumbras of indefiniteness have been upheld, and we think this one, too, is valid. See Commonwealth v. Brasher, 359 Mass. 550 (1974) (“stubborn child”); A Juvenile, petitioner, 364 Mass. 531 (1974) (statute allowing trial of juvenile if “the interests of the public” require it); Guardianship of a Minor, 1 Mass. App. Ct. 392 (1973) (“unfitness” in guardianship custody statute). Nor do we find a violation of the equal protection clause. If the argument be made that under § 3 State interposition in the parent-child relationship will occur more frequently in poor families than in wealthy ones, we can say no more than that the statute’s classification is not directly based on wealth, and a differential effect in practice on families with varying incomes occurs also *647with many valid laws. The overriding constitutional basis for the law is the State’s interest in protecting those children found on a reasonable basis to be in need of adoption. Decree affirmed. “Section 3. (a) Whenever a petition for adoption is filed by a person having the care or custody of a child, the consent of the . . . [parents] shall not be required if: — ... (ii) the court hearing the petition finds that the allowance of the petition is in the best interests of the child, as defined in paragraph (c). (b) The department of public welfare or any licensed child care agency may commence a proceeding, independent of a petition for adoption, in the probate court ... to dispense with the need for consent of . . . [a parent] to the adoption of a child in the care or custody of said department or agency. . . . The court shall issue a decree dispensing with the need for said consent . . . for adoption of such child subsequently sponsored by said department or agency if it finds that the best interests of the child as defined in paragraph (c) will be served by said decree. ...(c) In determining whether the best interests of the child will be served by granting a petition for adoption without requiring certain consent as permitted under paragraph (a), the court shall consider the ability, capacity, fitness and readiness of the child’s parents ... to assume parental responsibility and shall also consider the ability, capacity, fitness and readiness of the petitioners under paragraph (a) to assume such responsibilities. In determining whether the best interests of the child will be served by issuing a decree dispensing with the need of consent as permitted under paragraph (b), the court shall consider the ability, capacity, fitness and readiness of the child’s parents ... to assume parental responsibility, and shall also consider the plan proposed by the department or other agency initiating the petition. If said child has been in the care of the department or a licensed child care agency for more than one year, in each case irrespective of incidental communications or visits from his parents . . . there shall be a presumption that the best interests of the child will be served by granting a petition for *633adoption as permitted under paragraph (a) or by issuing a decree dispensing with the need for consent as permitted under paragraph (by “Section 5. .. . The probate court may, upon the written consent of the parents or surviving parent, order that the guardian shall have . . . custody; and may so order if, upon a hearing and after such notice to the parents or surviving parent as it may order, it finds such parents, jointly, or the surviving parent, unfit to have such custody; or if it finds one of them unfit to have such custody; or if it finds one of them unfit therefor and the other files in court his or her written consent to such order. ...” An investigation of the background of that family had furnished convincing evidence that they were suitable as adoptive parents. The decree itself of course did not consummate the adoption., A fresh petition in the Probate Court for adoption under G. L. c. 210, § 1, remains necessary, see also § 5A (requiring report by Department of Public Welfare or adoption agency on chüd and adoptive parents), but the § 2 requirement for parental consent was eliminated by the proceeding^ here in question, thus making the petition for adoption a simple proceeding. For example, in Adoption of a Minor, 343 Mass. 292 (1961), an aunt who had had custody of a child since a week after birth petitioned to adopt the child despite the objections of the mother. Though the mother was worthy to be a parent, we said expressly that the successive amendments of § 3 disclosed “a clear intent on the part of the Legislature to relax the requirement of parental consent to adoption when the withholding of consent by a neglectful parent would frustrate the furtherance of the best interests of the child.” Id. at 298. We accordingly took into account the bad effect on the child of breaking the bonds of affection between the aunt and the child, and approved the aunt’s adoption of the child. See Adoption of a Minor, 357 Mass. 490, 492 (1970); Adoption of a Minor, 362 Mass. 882 (1972). See also Adoption of a Minor, 338 Mass. 635 (1959) (applying “best interests” test to dispute over whether consent to adoption was necessary by unmarried father of child who later married mother); Erickson v. Raspperry, 320 Mass. 333 (1946) (applying “best interests” test to decide whether consent to adoption could be revoked). This 1972 legislation was part of a larger program of reform developed by the Governor’s Commission on Adoption and Foster Care which included the creation of an Office for Children. See the Governor’s message of February 9, 1972, House Doc. No. 5131. Also to be consulted is Professor Gruber’s influential later report to the Commission, Foster Home Care in Massachusetts (1973), as well as the Commission’s report, Governor’s Commission on Adoption and Foster Care, Report to Governor Sargent, March 14, 1973. The “presumption” was not relied on by the probate judge in her report in the present case and does not figure on this appeal. Alternatively, G. L. c. 119, § 23 (C), as appearing in St. 1970, c. 888, § 5, permits the Department of Public Welfare to “seek and . . . accept” on order of the Probate Court “responsibility” for minors “without proper guardianship due to the death, unavailability, incapacity or unfitness of the parent.” Such responsibility may, if the court orders, include the right to consent to adoption. Sections 24-26 allow a Juvenile Court (or the juvenile session of a District Court where there is no Juvenile Court) if it finds after petition by “any person” that a child is “without necessary and proper physical, educational or moral care and discipline, or is growing up under conditions or circumstances damaging to a child’s sound character development, or . . . lacks proper attention of parent . . . and whose parents . . . are unwilling, incompetent or unavailable to provide such care,” to commit the child to the custody of the department or “make any other appropriate order with reference to the care and custody of the child as may conduce to his best interests, including but not limited to” leaving the child with its parents under supervision, or transferring temporary custody to a qualified individual, agency, or the Department of Public Welfare. See n. 4 above. We are not drawn into the long standing debate among psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and lawyers about the precise limits of the claims of “biological” parents or about the precise values of “continuity” in the care of children. For the current phase, see Goldstein, Freud & Solnit, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973), and reviews by Dembitz, 83 Yale L. J. 1304 (1974); Katkin, Bullington & Levine, 8 Law & Soc. Rev. 669 (1974); Rothman & Rothman, 1 The Civ. Lib. Rev. 110 (1974). See also Mnookin, Foster Care — In Whose Best Interest? 43 Harv. Educ. Rev. 599 (1973). In White v. Minter, 330 F. Supp. 1194 (D. Mass. 1971), a three judge Federal court held that the G. L. c. 248, §§ 35-40, action by which a parent may seek to regain custody of a child was not adequate to protect a mother’s rights. The G. L. c. 248 action amounts to a “habeas corpus"" proceeding on behalf of a minor by its parent against those wrongfully hólding the child. In the White case, the Department of Public Welfare had obtained custody on a voluntary basis during a temporary illness, and the mother had sought to regain the child as soon as she was able to, within three weeks of the placement, and had continued to seek its return. The department, however, neither returned the child nor instituted an action under G. L. c. 119, § 23 (see n. 7 above), letting six months pass. In the circumstances, which are far from those of the present case, the court ruled that the mother’s rights had been violated. It held that the department must either return the child or bring suit for custody itself, finding the G. L. c. 248 action an inadequate remedy for the mother because under it, the court said, she had the “burden of proof.” Cf. Boyns v. Department of Pub. Welfare, 360 Mass. 600 (1971). In Stinson v. Meegan, 318 Mass. 459, 462 (1945), we had held that the issue in a G. L. c. 248 action was exactly that in a *644guardianship custody proceeding under G. L. c. 201, § 5: was the parent “unfit”? We think the basis of White, therefore, is less one of technical “burden of proof” than of imposition on the mother of the burden of instituting and prosecuting a lawsuit. In any event, White does not apply here. The mother here did not consistently seek the return of the child after she gave it up, and act toward that end. Moreover, it is likely here that the agency refrained from pressing any action against the mother in order to give her time to arrange her affairs and make plans to take the child back if she wished and was able to do so. It may well have felt that an earlier action would be premature because the mother had not yet demonstrated her unfitness, and because the child was still so young that the transfer back to its mother, if she were able and willing to assume responsibility, would not cause a profound shock to it. See 645-646 below. Compare the situation in Adoption of a Minor, 362 Mass. 842 (1973), in which the signed agreement was for adoption, and we held it therefore directly satisfied the G. L. c. 210, § 2, requirement of parental consent. Here no such consent was given, so a § 3 “best interests” inquiry was necessary in any event regardless of her consent to foster care. We do note, however, that in many cases foster parents are now being sponsored as adoptive parents; especially if the foster care has been extended, the putative emotional shock to the child of transfer may be an important factor in the calculus. As we have a report of material facts with the evidence not reported, “ [t]he facts found by the probate judge must be accepted as true. Richards v. Forrest, 278 Mass. 547, 551-552 [1932]. The sole question is ‘whether the findings of the judge “should in law require a decree different from that which was entered in the . . . [court below].”’ Cosgrove v.

3654791_1,2159,"The facts are fully stated in the opinion. His Honor sustained the demurrer, and plaintiff appealed. In section 1, chapter 70, of the acts of the General Assembly, passed at the session held in 1883, it was enacted : "" That it shall be unlawful for any live stock ( a word defined in section 10 ), to run at large in Lenoir and Greene counties, * Page 181 within the following boundaries, to - wit : beginning on the north bank of Neuse river, at the Lenoir and Wayne county line, thence with said line to the Greene county line, thence with the line between Greene and Wayne counties to the run of Nahunta creek, thence down said creek to Contentnea creek, thence down said creek to Neuse river, thence up said river to the beginning. "" The portion of this boundary formed by the last mentioned creek and the Neuse river into which it flows, as deep watercourses are declared in section 12 to be a sufficient barrier against the incursions of stock, and no fence is there required to be built. The same section requires the boards of the counties, from which is taken the territory to form the district, to erect an enclosing fence around the residue of the boundary, with gates at all the entering highways ; and, to defray the expense of the required work, the act declares that it shall be lawful for the said commissioners to levy and collect an assessment upon all the realty in the aforesaid territory. Provision is made in the section next preceding, for giving notice of the completed construction of the fence, ten days after which the act goes into full operation and its prohibitions cover the district. A month later during the same session was passed another act, declared in its title to be "" supplemental and amendatory, "" by which the remaining part of Greene county composed within designated lines, of which Contentnea creek ( here distinguished from another stream of the same name as "" Big Contentnea, "" ) constitutes a part and separates the two sections in that county, is erected into a district and subjected to the same general conditions, chapter 214. The other sections appropriate to the district thus established are the provisions of the former enactment relating to the construction of its enclosing fence and the raising of means to meet the expenses thereof, as well as the method of putting the act in operation. The barrier intervening between the separate districts, consisting in part of a fence and in part of a natural water course, * Page 182 is not removed so as to open egress from one into the other, and thus render needful to Lenoir the boundary fence required to enclose the additional territory in Greene ; but the original fencing and streams remain and are a full protection to all the territory in Lenoir. The value of the taxable real estate in the part of Greene which enters into the formation of the first district is $ 562, 969. 61, and the cost of constructing the fence therein is $ 1, 554 19 / 100, while the value of the real estate in the part taken from Lenoir is $ 1, 090, 112, and the cost of the fence in that county is $ 1, 725. In like manner it is ascertained that the value of the taxable real estate in the remaining part of Greene, constituting the second district, is $ 564, 945, and the cost of erecting the necessary fence therein is $ 3, 679 68 / 100. The commissioners of Lenoir refused to act in co - operation with the commissioners of Greene in providing for a uniform assessment upon all the lands lying in their respective counties to meet the expenses of enclosing the first district, or to recognize any obligation resting on Lenoir to contribute at all to the erection of the additional fencing required under the second act ; insisting that they were required to build the part of the line of fence in their county only. In consequence and in order to secure to Greene the benefits of this legislation, the commissioners of Greene have been compelled to provide the means of paying for the entire structure in their county. The present action looks to a re - adjustment of the expenses incurred, and a coercing judgment against the defendants, compelling them to make such a re - assessment upon the real estate in the portion of the district taken from Lenoir as shall be uniform with that rightfully falling upon the real estate in the part taken from Greene, and upon this basis refund the excess paid by the latter. These are the allegations of the complaint, and for the purpose of passing upon the issue made by the demurrer must be assumed to be true. The demurrer assigns, as the grounds thereof, ( 1 ) That the lands in Lenoir are only bound to pay for so much of the structure as lies within the county limits. * Page 183 ( 2 ) That the excess in the payments made under the assessment in Greene was unnecessary and officious, and furnishes no just ground for a claim against them. ( 3 ) That the right of action, if residing in any one, is in the persons interested in having the act carried out and the district properly protected from the inroads of outside stock, and not in the plaintiffs. Upon the hearing, the Court gave judgment sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the action, from which the plaintiffs appeal. The validity of this form of legislation, and its consistency with constitutional requirements, have been upheld in the several adjudications to which attention is called, and which are all reported in the 86th volume, Cain v. Commissioners, page 8 ; Newsom v. Earnheart, page 391 ; Shuford v. Commissioners, page 552. In the first of these it is said by the Court, "" It creates a community of interest in upholding one barrier in place of separate and distinct barriers for each plantation, and thus in the common burden, lessens the weight that each cultivator of the soil must otherwise individually bear. "" As the greater burden is thus removed from the land - owner he, as such, ought to bear the expense by which this result is brought about. The special interest benefited by the law is charged with the payment of the sum necessary in securing the benefit. This and no more is what the statute proposes to do, and in this respect is obnoxious to no just objection from the taxed land - proprietor, as it is free from any constitutional impediments. "" An assessment for local improvements is not considered so much a burden as it is an equivalent or compensation for the enhanced value which the taxed property is supposed to derive from the work. It is an instance of the application of the general maxim qui sentit commodum debet sentire et onus, the consideration paid for the special local benefit conferred. This is the underlying principle of the system of local assessment for local advantages, and in its development and application to the present case most manifestly requires that the lands in * Page 184 Lenoir and Greene constituting the district under the first act, without any reference to county lines, should be assessed and charged according to value and at a uniform rate. The common fence dispenses with separate fences throughout the circumscribed territory for separate farms, and thus the relief is diffused generally among tax - paying owners. The result is not affected by the fact that parts of two counties are united in creating the district, and that separate yet concurring action of the commissioners in each is necessary to the execution of the law. For the purpose of local assessment it is a single district, as much so as if constituted of part of one county, and as the levy of taxes is confined to county officers, their agency in enforcing them must of course be independently exercised. It was their duty after ascertaining the expense of the required work to inquire what per centum of tax upon the aggregate value of all the real estate subject to assessment in the entire district would suffice to meet it, and then levy such to raise the needed amount. The plaintiffs have cause of complaint against the defendants for refusing their co - operation. But the other territory in Greene is erected into a separate district, with a separate enclosure and must bear its own expenses. It has the benefits of the fence constructed at the cost of the first district, so far as it forms a dividing line between them. It cannot rightfully demand a construction from the tax - payers in Lenoir whose property derives no advantage whatever from the additional fencing. Its full protection is secured by that in whose building they have to participate. Nor do we find any difficulty in construing the sections of chapter 214 which refer to chapter 70. They are obviously intended to introduce the mode of procedure prescribed in the former for carrying into effect the provisions, having a similar object in view, contained in the latter. No concert of action was necessary with the authorities of other counties, and hence they were to assess the lands in the separate district so as to raise a sufficient sum to meet the expense of the required fence around it. * Page 185 We think, too, the mandatory authority of the court may be invoked to compel the performance of the denied obligation imposed upon the defendants. They have failed hitherto to levy the full assessment upon the real estate in their county liable under the statute, and this has compelled an excessive levy upon the owners of real estate in Greene in order to secure the beneficial objects of the law. The adjustment must be among those respective tax - payers, but it can only be attained through a new assessment collected and paid over to the county authorities of Greene to replace the moneys wrongfully collected in that county, and to be held in trust for those who have over - paid, as should have been that wrongfully used in payment for the fence. The representative county agencies are the appropriate parties to an action to correct the wrong and bring about the preexisting state of things, as if it had not been done. The very fact that said boards must unite in accomplishing what ought to have been done in the beginning shows the propriety of the present action. The trust fund when received belongs to the overcharged tax - payers and may be retained as a special credit to each in a general collection of county taxes, and thus the wrong redressed. There is error, and the judgment must be reversed. Let this be certified. Reversed.",3654791,"The facts are fully stated in the opinion. His Honor sustained the demurrer, and plaintiff appealed. In section 1, chapter 70, of the acts of the General Assembly, passed at the session held in 1883, it was enacted: ""That it shall be unlawful for any live stock (a word defined in section 10), to run at large in Lenoir and Greene counties, *Page 181 within the following boundaries, to-wit: beginning on the north bank of Neuse river, at the Lenoir and Wayne county line, thence with said line to the Greene county line, thence with the line between Greene and Wayne counties to the run of Nahunta creek, thence down said creek to Contentnea creek, thence down said creek to Neuse river, thence up said river to the beginning."" The portion of this boundary formed by the last mentioned creek and the Neuse river into which it flows, as deep watercourses are declared in section 12 to be a sufficient barrier against the incursions of stock, and no fence is there required to be built. The same section requires the boards of the counties, from which is taken the territory to form the district, to erect an enclosing fence around the residue of the boundary, with gates at all the entering highways; and, to defray the expense of the required work, the act declares that it shall be lawful for the said commissioners to levy and collect an assessment upon all the realty in the aforesaid territory. Provision is made in the section next preceding, for giving notice of the completed construction of the fence, ten days after which the act goes into full operation and its prohibitions cover the district. A month later during the same session was passed another act, declared in its title to be ""supplemental and amendatory,"" by which the remaining part of Greene county composed within designated lines, of which Contentnea creek (here distinguished from another stream of the same name as ""Big Contentnea,"") constitutes a part and separates the two sections in that county, is erected into a district and subjected to the same general conditions, chapter 214. The other sections appropriate to the district thus established are the provisions of the former enactment relating to the construction of its enclosing fence and the raising of means to meet the expenses thereof, as well as the method of putting the act in operation. The barrier intervening between the separate districts, consisting in part of a fence and in part of a natural water course, *Page 182 is not removed so as to open egress from one into the other, and thus render needful to Lenoir the boundary fence required to enclose the additional territory in Greene; but the original fencing and streams remain and are a full protection to all the territory in Lenoir. The value of the taxable real estate in the part of Greene which enters into the formation of the first district is $562,969.61, and the cost of constructing the fence therein is $1,554 19/100, while the value of the real estate in the part taken from Lenoir is $1,090,112, and the cost of the fence in that county is $1,725. In like manner it is ascertained that the value of the taxable real estate in the remaining part of Greene, constituting the second district, is $564,945, and the cost of erecting the necessary fence therein is $3,679 68/100. The commissioners of Lenoir refused to act in co-operation with the commissioners of Greene in providing for a uniform assessment upon all the lands lying in their respective counties to meet the expenses of enclosing the first district, or to recognize any obligation resting on Lenoir to contribute at all to the erection of the additional fencing required under the second act; insisting that they were required to build the part of the line of fence in their county only. In consequence and in order to secure to Greene the benefits of this legislation, the commissioners of Greene have been compelled to provide the means of paying for the entire structure in their county. The present action looks to a re-adjustment of the expenses incurred, and a coercing judgment against the defendants, compelling them to make such a re-assessment upon the real estate in the portion of the district taken from Lenoir as shall be uniform with that rightfully falling upon the real estate in the part taken from Greene, and upon this basis refund the excess paid by the latter. These are the allegations of the complaint, and for the purpose of passing upon the issue made by the demurrer must be assumed to be true. The demurrer assigns, as the grounds thereof, (1) That the lands in Lenoir are only bound to pay for so much of the structure as lies within the county limits. *Page 183 (2) That the excess in the payments made under the assessment in Greene was unnecessary and officious, and furnishes no just ground for a claim against them. (3) That the right of action, if residing in any one, is in the persons interested in having the act carried out and the district properly protected from the inroads of outside stock, and not in the plaintiffs. Upon the hearing, the Court gave judgment sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the action, from which the plaintiffs appeal. The validity of this form of legislation, and its consistency with constitutional requirements, have been upheld in the several adjudications to which attention is called, and which are all reported in the 86th volume, Cain v. Commissioners , page 8; Newsom v. Earnheart , page 391; Shuford v. Commissioners , page 552. In the first of these it is said by the Court, ""It creates a community of interest in upholding one barrier in place of separate and distinct barriers for each plantation, and thus in the common burden, lessens the weight that each cultivator of the soil must otherwise individually bear. ""As the greater burden is thus removed from the land-owner he, as such, ought to bear the expense by which this result is brought about. The special interest benefited by the law is charged with the payment of the sum necessary in securing the benefit. This and no more is what the statute proposes to do, and in this respect is obnoxious to no just objection from the taxed land-proprietor, as it is free from any constitutional impediments."" An assessment for local improvements is not considered so much a burden as it is an equivalent or compensation for the enhanced value which the taxed property is supposed to derive from the work. It is an instance of the application of the general maxim qui sentit commodum debet sentire et onus , the consideration paid for the special local benefit conferred. This is the underlying principle of the system of local assessment for local advantages, and in its development and application to the present case most manifestly requires that the lands in *Page 184 Lenoir and Greene constituting the district under the first act, without any reference to county lines, should be assessed and charged according to value and at a uniform rate. The common fence dispenses with separate fences throughout the circumscribed territory for separate farms, and thus the relief is diffused generally among tax-paying owners. The result is not affected by the fact that parts of two counties are united in creating the district, and that separate yet concurring action of the commissioners in each is necessary to the execution of the law. For the purpose of local assessment it is a single district, as much so as if constituted of part of one county, and as the levy of taxes is confined to county officers, their agency in enforcing them must of course be independently exercised. It was their duty after ascertaining the expense of the required work to inquire what per centum of tax upon the aggregate value of all the real estate subject to assessment in the entire district would suffice to meet it, and then levy such to raise the needed amount. The plaintiffs have cause of complaint against the defendants for refusing their co-operation. But the other territory in Greene is erected into a separate district, with a separate enclosure and must bear its own expenses. It has the benefits of the fence constructed at the cost of the first district, so far as it forms a dividing line between them. It cannot rightfully demand a construction from the tax-payers in Lenoir whose property derives no advantage whatever from the additional fencing. Its full protection is secured by that in whose building they have to participate. Nor do we find any difficulty in construing the sections of chapter 214 which refer to chapter 70. They are obviously intended to introduce the mode of procedure prescribed in the former for carrying into effect the provisions, having a similar object in view, contained in the latter. No concert of action was necessary with the authorities of other counties, and hence they were to assess the lands in the separate district so as to raise a sufficient sum to meet the expense of the required fence around it. *Page 185 We think, too, the mandatory authority of the court may be invoked to compel the performance of the denied obligation imposed upon the defendants. They have failed hitherto to levy the full assessment upon the real estate in their county liable under the statute, and this has compelled an excessive levy upon the owners of real estate in Greene in order to secure the beneficial objects of the law. The adjustment must be among those respective tax-payers, but it can only be attained through a new assessment collected and paid over to the county authorities of Greene to replace the moneys wrongfully collected in that county, and to be held in trust for those who have over-paid, as should have been that wrongfully used in payment for the fence. The representative county agencies are the appropriate parties to an action to correct the wrong and bring about the preexisting state of things, as if it had not been done. The very fact that said boards must unite in accomplishing what ought to have been done in the beginning shows the propriety of the present action.

6673247_1,3800,"The opinion of the Court was delivered by Willard, A. J. The relators allege that the ordinance of the city of Columbia imposing upon them, as bankers, payment of a sum of money by way of a license is invalid, and they ask that the respondents be restrained from enforcing such ordinance by a writ of prohibition issued out of this Court. The propositions advanced by the relators in support of this position resolve themselves into the following : 1. That, as an incorporated company, transacting banking business under a charter from the Legislature, they are not liable to pay any corporate tax for carrying on such business. 2. That they have paid the tax imposed by the Act entitled “ An Act to provide for a general license law, ” approved March 13, 1872. 3. That the ordinance, considered as a means of raising revenue, is not “ taxation ” in the sense of the enactment conferring power to tax on the city corporation. 4. That, considered as a means of imposing a tax, such tax is not equal and uniform in respect to persons and property. 5. That the charge imposed is not a reasonable charge or tax. In order to determine the force of these various propositions, it is requisite to inquire : First. Whether the enactment of the ordinance in question is to be regarded as the exercise of the power of imposing taxes ; and, Second. Whether the charges imposed on the relato : s by the ordinance is equal and uniform in respect of persons and property. * 5The authority under which the respondents acted in the passage of the ordinance in question is contained in Section 8, Article IX, of the Constitution, which is as follows : “ The corporate authorities of Counties, townships, school districts, cities, towns and villages may be vested with power to assess and collect taxes for corporate purposes, such tax to be uniform in respect to persons and property within the jurisdiction of the body imposing the same ; ” and in Section 8 of an Act amending the charter of Columbia, approved March 2, 1871, ( 14 Stat., 572, ) as follows : “ That the said Mayor and Aldermen are hereby empowered to require all persons, companies and corporations now engaged, or who hereafter may be engaged, in business or avocations of any kind whatever, within the limits of the city of Columbia, to take out a license from the Mayor and Aldermen of the said city, who are hereby authorized to impose a reasonable charge or tax for the conduct of the same. ” It is evident that the ordinance in question imposing a tax by way of license upon the relators on account of their business as bankers is in pursuance of the authority conferred ' by the statute just quoted, unless the relators establish their proposition that it is not reasonable. This proposition will be hereafter examined ; and, in the meantime, the reasonableness of the charge will be assumed for the purpose of examining the other branches of the argument. The question before us, then, is one of conflict between the grant of authority by the Act and the provisions of the Constitution already quoted. We come now to the question whether the enactment of the ordinance is to be regarded as the exercise of the power of imposing taxes. The constitutional authority extends, in terms, to power “ to assess and collect taxes for corporate purposes. ” If the charge imposed cannot be regarded as a tax in the sense in which that term is employed in the Constitution, then the respondents would have to look to some other source of authority for their action than this Section of the Constitution. The relators allege that the charge imposed upon them cannot be considered a tax in the sense of the Constitution. They contend that power to enact a license and impose a license fee necessarily implies a right to control the business in respect of which the license fee is demanded, either by prohibiting its exercise or permitting such exercise only upon conditions imposed according to the discretion of the city authorities. * 6 • Their proposition that the authority under which they conduct their business is derived directly from the Legislature through their charter of incorporation depends for its force upon the idea just presented of the nature of licenses and. license fees. Strictly speaking, a license of a trade or calling by a municipal corporation is referable to the police power possessed by such bodies, and implies authority to prohibit the exercise of such business, except upon conditions having reference to some end of police regulation. In its simplest form - of exercise, as where employed solely for the purpose of regulating avocations of a class tending to disturb public order, health or morality, it is a power totally distinct from that of imposing taxes for the purpose of raising revenue. It has, however, been long employed for the purpose of imposing, on a class of avocations to which the exercise of that power particularly relates, embracing places of public entertainment and amusement, taxation for rhe purpose of revenue of an extraordinary character, based upon the idea that avocations of that class should contribute specially to the support of the government in excess of the burdens borne by the productive industries. In this way it became one of the customary modes of raising revenue. The extension of this mode of raising revenue beyond the sphere of avocations to which the power of police regulation properly related, where circumstances of a peculiar nature rendered it requisite that each particular avocation should have its own rate of taxation, was natural where taxation had divided itself into two methods, the one embracing those subjects of taxation that are capable of being reached by means of an uniform rate, and the other such as could be treated in no other way than by subdivision into distinct classes and imposing a separate rate on each of such classes. Avocations of the class to which the power of public regulation properly relates naturally fall within the class of subjects of taxation last named, and the license, as a form of collecting special taxes, has been frequently extended to embrace all subjects of taxation calling for special rates of taxation. The law, always looking rather to substance than to names in fixing the nature of an imposition by way of license, looks directly to the end in view. If it finds that end to be a regulation tending to preserve public qrder, health or morality, it adjudges accordingly, applying the rules governing the exercise of the police power of the community ; if, on the other hand, it finds that the object in view is * 7the requisition of revenue exclusively, it applies the rules intended to regulate the taxing power. Under this view, we must look into the ordinance and the statute on which it is founded in order to ascertain whether the end and object was the imposition of taxation, or of some different character. The views just presented will be found fully carried out in United States vs. Vassar, ( 5 Wallace, 462, ) Purvear vs. Massachusetts, ( 5 Wallace, 475, ) and New York vs. Railroad, ( 32 N. Y., 261. ) The statute under which the ordinance in question was passed uses the words “ charge ” or “ tax ” as descriptive of the nature of the imposition which the city government was authorized to make on the various trades and avocations carried on within its corporate limits. This expression, coupled with the fact that no other end than that of raising revenue for the support of the city government is disclosed in the statute, leads to the conclusion that the power intended to be conferred on the corporation was ' that of taxation. The ordinance is equally clear on the subject. It does not subject the persons engaged in the various avocations to the performance of any other duty than that of paying the license fee fixed by the ordinance, nor does it impose any penalty or restriction whatever in respect of such avocation other than such as relates to the * ' collection of such license fee. This view makes it clear that the - ordinance intended exclusively the exercise of the taxing power. It appears that the ordinance is to be regarded as an exercise of the taxing power, and as such its validity is to be determined by the rules and regulations governing the exercise of the power of imposing taxes. In the case of State vs. Hayne, ( 4 S. C., 403, ) this Court held that a tax upon business and avocations was a legitimate mode of exercising the taxing power, and that in the absence of constitutional limitations the Legislature could properly fix a separate rate for each description of avocation embraced. We also held that the Constitution of this State permitted taxation of that class. It must be held, therefore, that the Legislature had power to authorize the imposition of a tax on avocations and business by a municipal corporation, and to confer on such bodies power to fix a separate rate for each distinct class of the subjects of taxation embraced within it, unless the language of the Constitution, quoted above, is to be construed as rendering it imperative, that a single rate should be applied to all such subjects of taxation equally. * 8We come, at this point, to the examination of the second question suggested above, namely : Whether the charge imposed on the relators, by the ordinance, is “ uniform in respect of persons and property. ” This question arises under the clause of the Constitution already quoted, and is specially applied to local and municipal taxation. The provisions of the Constitution that such taxes shall be “ uniform in respect to persons and propérty within the jurisdiction of the body imposing the same ” is clearly a limitation on all kinds and modes of taxation that may be resorted to by local and municipal bodies, and as such is the test of the validity of the tax under consideration. It may be observed that the contrary would be the conclusion if the provision was to be so construed as to apply only to taxes strictly personal and taxes upon property. That such was not the intention is deducible from the fact that a strictly personal tax is identical with a poll tax, which municipal bodies are excluded from imposing. —. Const., Art. 9, § 2. The direct sense of the provision is that all taxes shall have an uniform operation as affecting the persons and property "" to which they relate. In this sense, taxes upon avocations and business would be equally included and would be compelled to conform to the general rule. There is no sound reason to be derived either from the language of the Constitution or from the nature of the subject matter of which it treats for departing from this direct interpretation of the terms used. If equality and uniformity as the rule of taxation are desirable in the case of a poll tax, or a tax on property as such, it is equally desirable that it should apply to taxation on avocations and business. The true operation and effect, therefore, of the provision under examination is to prevent discrimination among individuals liable to taxation on personal grounds, or as it regards the right to have all visible and tangible property taxed according to its value. Every tax imposed under our tax laws involves a person by whom the burden is to be borne, a subject of taxation, and a sum or rate to be paid by such person in respect of such subject of taxation. It is, therefore, to be considered whether the tax in question makes an improper discrimination as it regards the different individuals or classes of individuals affected by it, or whether it in * 9effect taxes property without regard to the principle of applying an uniform rate according to value. An improper discrimination as it regards the persons upon whom the tax is imposed, is one that does not arise from the nature of the subject matter in respect of which he is taxed, but from something that characterizes the individual as such, apart from all consideration of the nature and situation of the thing in respect of which the taxation is imposed. Where such a discrimination exists, it would be possible that two persons taxed in respect of the same subject matter might be subjected to the payment of unequal sums. Where, however, the law is so framed that the amount of taxation imposed on account of a particular subject of taxation cannot vary by whomsoever it is to be paid, the law cannot be said to be unequal and without uniformity as it respects persons. The ordinance in question does not make any personal distinctions. It divides the various avocations and business into separate classes and descriptions and affixes a rate to each ; but all persons within the territorial jurisdiction following such avocations or business are subjected to like taxation. Nor does the ordinance violate the principle of taxing property according to value according to an uniform rate. Had it increased or decreased the amount of taxation due from any person on account of his avocation or business according to the quantity or value of property held by such person or employed in his business ■when the amount of property was not the proper standard for the measure of the value of such business, it might be proper to inquire whether such taxation did not cover a kind of taxation on property not permitted by our Constitution. But such does not appear to be the case. The tax imposed upon the relators is not of that character, nor does it appear that they are subjected to any increased sum or rate of taxation by reason of any improper discrimination allowed by the ordinance to any person or corporation other than the relators. The foregoing views are abundantly sustained by numerous well - considered and harmonious authorities. In Mirriam vs. New Orleans, ( 14 La. Ann., 318, ) it was held that a requirement that all taxes should be equal and uniform was not violated by an ordinance taxing keepers of billiard saloons according to the number of tables employed in such business. * 10A similar feature exists in the ordinance in question. The number of billiard tables employed is not an improper measure of the amount and value of the business done, and it cannot be regarded as virtually a tax on the tables considered as property. So in Hodgson vs. New Orleans, ( 21 La. Ann., 301, ) the number of warehouses employed by a warehouseman being the measure of the tax imposed, it was held to be uniform and equal. This, too, was a legitimate mode of measuring the extent and value of the business as such. Fletcher vs. Oliver ( 25 Ark., 289, ) affords an instance of the violation of the rule of equality and uniformity, where a discrimination was made between resident and non - resident property holders. Mason vs. Trustees ( 4 Bush Ky., 406, ) and Nashville vs. Althorpe ( 5 Cold. Tenn., 354, ) also illustrate the nature of personal discriminations in accordance with the view just advanced. In Attorney General vs. Plank Road, ( 11 Wis., 35, ) Judge Paine discussed with great clearness the sense of the terms “ equal ”. and “ uniform ” as applied to taxation and throws much light upon the subject. In Bank vs. Hines, ( 3 Ohio, 1, ) Chief Justice Bartley gives a full and clear definition of the terms “ equal ” and “ uniform, ” as applied to property taxation. An examination of the principles upon which the foregoing cases rest will show that the conclusions stated above are in harmony with the views that have been elicited in the various States where questions involving these principles have arisen for adjudication. We must therefore conclude that the tax imposed by the ordinance in question Í3 not obnoxious to the clause of the Constitution imposing limits upon municipal taxation. The points of objection made to the ordinance will next be separately considered. The objection that because the relators are a chartered corporation they aré not subject to this form of taxation depends on the idea that the license intended by the ordinance is an attempt to control their general right of transacting banking business, and therefore in conflict with their charter conferring that right. This, as we have seen, is not the correct view of the ordinance. As a measure of taxation, the relators are equally subject to its provisions with all other persons, natural or artificial. Nor does the payment of the license tax imposed by the government of the State relieve them from the necessity of paying local taxes. * 11The only objection not already disposed of is that the tax in question is unreasonable. No ground appears for holding either that the ordinance as a whole is an unreasonable exercise of the taxing power conferred upon the city corporation or that the particular sum imposed in respect of the business carried on by the relators is unreasonable. The mode of taxation adopted in this case, including the fixing of a separate rate for each distinct avocation and kind of business, is not in itself unreasonable, as we have already seen. Nor can we say, from anything disclosed by the ordinance or pleadings, either that the aggregate sum or rate imposed by the ordinance is in excess of what is reasonably needed for the support of the city government or that it is in excess of what should be borne by the class of subjects of taxation to which the ordinance applies ; nor can we say, from anything that appears, that any rule or principle of uniformity has been violated in fixing the proportionate part of the whole sum or rate that should be borne by the relators as bankers. It is not therefore necessary to define what was intended by limiting the corporation to a reasonable exercise of the powers conferred, there being nothing in the case putting the question of reasonableness at issue. The remaining ground advanced by the relators for the granting of the prohibition is an alleged want of power on the part of the respondents to issue process for the collection of taxes. The power conferred on the respondents, as we have seen, is to assess and collect taxes. This implies more than the power to sue for such taxes, and includes the right to use and employ whatever remedies have been usually employed for that purpose. The practice of issuing tax executions for the collection of taxes existed at the adoption of the Constitution, and had long existed prior to that time, ( State vs. Hodges, 14 Rich., 256, ) and must be deemed embraced by the authority to “ collect ” conferred by that instrument. The motion of the relators should be denied. Moses, C. J., and Wright, A. J., concurred.",6673247," The opinion of the Court was delivered by Willard, A. J. The relators allege that the ordinance of the city of Columbia imposing upon them, as bankers, payment of a sum of money by way of a license is invalid, and they ask that the respondents be restrained from enforcing such ordinance by a writ of prohibition issued out of this Court.

The statute under which the ordinance in question was passed uses the words “charge” or “tax” as descriptive of the nature of the imposition which the city government was authorized to make on the various trades and avocations carried on within its corporate limits. This expression, coupled with the fact that no other end than that of raising revenue for the support of the city government is disclosed in the statute, leads to the conclusion that the power intended to be conferred on the corporation was' that of taxation.

It does not subject the persons engaged in the various avocations to the performance of any other duty than that of paying the license fee fixed by the ordinance, nor does it impose any penalty or restriction whatever in respect of such avocation other than such as relates to the*' collection of such license fee. This view makes it clear that the -ordinance intended exclusively the exercise of the taxing power. It appears that the ordinance is to be regarded as an exercise of the taxing power, and as such its validity is to be determined by the rules and regulations governing the exercise of the power of imposing taxes. In the case of State vs. Hayne, (4 S. C., 403,) this Court held that a tax upon business and avocations was a legitimate mode of exercising the taxing power, and that in the absence of constitutional limitations the Legislature could properly fix a separate rate for each description of avocation embraced. We also held that the Constitution of this State permitted taxation of that class. It must be held, therefore, that the Legislature had power to authorize the imposition of a tax on avocations and business by a municipal corporation, and to confer on such bodies power to fix a separate rate for each distinct class of the subjects of taxation embraced within it, unless the language of the Constitution, quoted above, is to be construed as rendering it imperative, that a single rate should be applied to all such subjects of taxation equally. *8We come, at this point, to the examination of the second question suggested above, namely: Whether the charge imposed on the relators, by the ordinance, is “ uniform in respect of persons and property.” This question arises under the clause of the Constitution already quoted, and is specially applied to local and municipal taxation. The provisions of the Constitution that such taxes shall be “ uniform in respect to persons and propérty within the jurisdiction of the body imposing the same” is clearly a limitation on all kinds and modes of taxation that may be resorted to by local and municipal bodies, and as such is the test of the validity of the tax under consideration. It may be observed that the contrary would be the conclusion if the provision was to be so construed as to apply only to taxes strictly personal and taxes upon property. That such was not the intention is deducible from the fact that a strictly personal tax is identical with a poll tax, which municipal bodies are excluded from imposing. — .Const., Art. 9, § 2. The direct sense of the provision is that all taxes shall have an uniform operation as affecting the persons and property ""to which they relate. In this sense, taxes upon avocations and business would be equally included and would be compelled to conform to the general rule. There is no sound reason to be derived either from the language of the Constitution or from the nature of the subject matter of which it treats for departing from this direct interpretation of the terms used. If equality and uniformity as the rule of taxation are desirable in the case of a poll tax, or a tax on property as such, it is equally desirable that it should apply to taxation on avocations and business. The true operation and effect, therefore, of the provision under examination is to prevent discrimination among individuals liable to taxation on personal grounds, or as it regards the right to have all visible and tangible property taxed according to its value. Every tax imposed under our tax laws involves a person by whom the burden is to be borne, a subject of taxation, and a sum or rate to be paid by such person in respect of such subject of taxation. It is, therefore, to be considered whether the tax in question makes an improper discrimination as it regards the different individuals or classes of individuals affected by it, or whether it in *9effect taxes property without regard to the principle of applying an uniform rate according to value. An improper discrimination as it regards the persons upon whom the tax is imposed, is one that does not arise from the nature of the subject matter in respect of which he is taxed, but from something that characterizes the individual as such, apart from all consideration of the nature and situation of the thing in respect of which the taxation is imposed. Where such a discrimination exists, it would be possible that two persons taxed in respect of the same subject matter might be subjected to the payment of unequal sums. Where, however, the law is so framed that the amount of taxation imposed on account of a particular subject of taxation cannot vary by whomsoever it is to be paid, the law cannot be said to be unequal and without uniformity as it respects persons. The ordinance in question does not make any personal distinctions. It divides the various avocations and business into separate classes and descriptions and affixes a rate to each; but all persons within the territorial jurisdiction following such avocations or business are subjected to like taxation. Nor does the ordinance violate the principle of taxing property according to value according to an uniform rate. Had it increased or decreased the amount of taxation due from any person on account of his avocation or business according to the quantity or value of property held by such person or employed in his business ■when the amount of property was not the proper standard for the measure of the value of such business, it might be proper to inquire whether such taxation did not cover a kind of taxation on property not permitted by our Constitution. But such does not appear to be the case. The tax imposed upon the relators is not of that character, nor does it appear that they are subjected to any increased sum or rate of taxation by reason of any improper discrimination allowed by the ordinance to any person or corporation other than the relators. The foregoing views are abundantly sustained by numerous well-considered and harmonious authorities. In Mirriam vs. New Orleans, (14 La. Ann., 318,) it was held that a requirement that all taxes should be equal and uniform was not violated by an ordinance taxing keepers of billiard saloons according to the number of tables employed in such business. *10A similar feature exists in the ordinance in question. The number of billiard tables employed is not an improper measure of the amount and value of the business done, and it cannot be regarded as virtually a tax on the tables considered as property. So in Hodgson vs. New Orleans, (21 La. Ann., 301,) the number of warehouses employed by a warehouseman being the measure of the tax imposed, it was held to be uniform and equal. This, too, was a legitimate mode of measuring the extent and value of the business as such. Fletcher vs. Oliver (25 Ark., 289,) affords an instance of the violation of the rule of equality and uniformity, where a discrimination was made between resident and non-resident property holders. Mason vs. Trustees (4 Bush Ky., 406,) and Nashville vs. Althorpe (5 Cold. Tenn., 354,) also illustrate the nature of personal discriminations in accordance with the view just advanced. In Attorney General vs. Plank Road, (11 Wis., 35,) Judge Paine discussed with great clearness the sense of the terms “equal”.and “uniform” as applied to taxation and throws much light upon the subject. In Bank vs. Hines, (3 Ohio, 1,) Chief Justice Bartley gives a full and clear definition of the terms “equal” and “uniform,” as applied to property taxation. An examination of the principles upon which the foregoing cases rest will show that the conclusions stated above are in harmony with the views that have been elicited in the various States where questions involving these principles have arisen for adjudication. We must therefore conclude that the tax imposed by the ordinance in question Í3 not obnoxious to the clause of the Constitution imposing limits upon municipal taxation. The points of objection made to the ordinance will next be separately considered. The objection that because the relators are a chartered corporation they aré not subject to this form of taxation depends on the idea that the license intended by the ordinance is an attempt to control their general right of transacting banking business, and therefore in conflict with their charter conferring that right. This, as we have seen, is not the correct view of the ordinance. As a measure of taxation, the relators are equally subject to its provisions with all other persons, natural or artificial. Nor does the payment of the license tax imposed by the government of the State relieve them from the necessity of paying local taxes. *11The only objection not already disposed of is that the tax in question is unreasonable. No ground appears for holding either that the ordinance as a whole is an unreasonable exercise of the taxing power conferred upon the city corporation or that the particular sum imposed in respect of the business carried on by the relators is unreasonable. The mode of taxation adopted in this case, including the fixing of a separate rate for each distinct avocation and kind of business, is not in itself unreasonable, as we have already seen. Nor can we say, from anything disclosed by the ordinance or pleadings, either that the aggregate sum or rate imposed by the ordinance is in excess of what is reasonably needed for the support of the city government or that it is in excess of what should be borne by the class of subjects of taxation to which the ordinance applies; nor can we say, from anything that appears, that any rule or principle of uniformity has been violated in fixing the proportionate part of the whole sum or rate that should be borne by the relators as bankers. It is not therefore necessary to define what was intended by limiting the corporation to a reasonable exercise of the powers conferred, there being nothing in the case putting the question of reasonableness at issue. The remaining ground advanced by the relators for the granting of the prohibition is an alleged want of power on the part of the respondents to issue process for the collection of taxes. The power conferred on the respondents, as we have seen, is to assess and collect taxes. This implies more than the power to sue for such taxes, and includes the right to use and employ whatever remedies have been usually employed for that purpose. The practice of issuing tax executions for the collection of taxes existed at the adoption of the Constitution, and had long existed prior to that time, (State vs. Hodges, 14 Rich., 256,) and must be deemed embraced by the authority to “collect” conferred by that instrument. The motion of the relators should be denied. Moses, C. J., and Wright, A. J., concurred.

5047382_1,2493,"STERNBERG, Justice. Ruth Harlow, widow of Carl Harlow, in her individual capacity and in her administrative capacity, attacks the validity of Carl ’ s last will and testament and also seeks to set aside a settlement of claim that she made with Clarence Harlow, her brother - in - law, on the grounds that it was induced by duress, fraud and deceit. Carl Harlow died testate on July 22, 1968, a resident of Letcher County, Kentucky. Carl and Clarence were partners in the “ Harlow Motor Company. ” In 1955 each of them executed a will which contained a reciprocal provision relating to the disposition of the business upon the death of either of them. It was provided thereby that the survivor shall have all of the interest of the other upon the payment of $ 85, 000 to the estate of the deceased brother. On August 7, 1968, Ruth filed an application in the Letcher County Court to be appointed as the administratrix of her deceased husband ’ s estate. On the same date she was duly appointed and duly qualified. Thereafter, but on the same date, Carl ’ s will was discovered, and on the same date it was presented to the Letcher County Court for probate. It was duly probated and Ruth was appointed executrix thereof. She duly qualified and her bond in the sum of $ 120, 000 was approved. Appraisers of the estate were duly appointed. To their report, Ruth, as executrix, filed exceptions, which were later overruled. On September 23, 1968, Ruth, acting in her individual capacity and in her capacity as executrix of Carl ’ s will, executed a receipt and release of all claims, demands and rights of action against Clarence Harlow and the property of every character owned by the Harlow Motor Company. In consideration therefor Clarence paid Ruth the sum of $ 87, 000 and surrendered to her certain other personal items owned by Carl at the time of his demise, which were kept by Carl at the Harlow Motor Company. On September 14, 1971, Ruth, acting in her individual capacity and as administra - trix of Carl ’ s estate, filed motions to set aside the order of the Letcher County Court dated August 7, 1968, probating Carl ’ s will or, in the alternative, to allow her to file a renunciation as authorized by KRS 392. 080. On February 23, 1972, the motions were heard by a special judge of the Letcher County Court. A transcript of the evidence is duly filed in the record. On April 30, 1973, the special judge entered an order overruling both motions. On May 1, 1973, a statement of appeal from the April 30, 1973, order of the Letch - er County Court was filed by Ruth, as wid * 232ow of Carl, in the Letcher Circuit Court ( Civil Action Number 4771 ). On the same date, as Carl ’ s widow and administratrix of his estate, Ruth filed an original action in the Letcher Circuit Court against Clarence Harlow and others, in which she attacked the September 23, 1968, settlement ( Civil Action Number 4772 ). She charged, among other allegations, that the “ receipt and release of claim ” dated September 23, 1968, was procured from her under duress, fraud and deceit. The allegations of the complaint were generally traversed and by affirmative pleading it is charged that the substance of the action is, in effect, to renounce the will of Carl Harlow and that Ruth had not complied with the provisions of KRS 392. 080 in doing so. These two actions were consolidated on the trial court ’ s own motion. In Action Number 4771 the trial judge sustained a motion to dismiss and in Action Number 4772 he sustained a motion for a summary judgment. Thereupon, both cases were dismissed. Action Number 4771 is the attack on the probate of Carl ’ s will. In considering the propriety of the court ’ s action in sustaining the motion to dismiss, we must bear in mind that such motion will not be granted unless it appears that the plaintiff will not be entitled to relief under any state of facts which would be proven in support of the claim. Ingram v. Ingram, Ky., 283 S. W. 2d 210 ( 1955 ). “ Since the dominion of an owner over his property ends at his death, the law must provide for the devolution of that property. If the owner has chosen to dispose of it by will, the property must pass according to the terms of the will ; if there is no will, the law alone, through the rules of descent and distribution, accomplishes the transfer and designates the persons who are to take. ” 23 Am. Jur. 2d, Descent and Distribution, § 1, p. 749. In Kentucky, upon a person ’ s death, we have provided for the devolution of property either by testate succession ( KRS Ch. 394 ) or by intestate succession ( KRS Chs. 391, 392 ). In Eckert v. Givan, 298 Ky. 621, 183 S. W. 2d 809 ( 1944 ), this court said : “ Ella Hiller qualified as the executrix under the will of her deceased husband. She had the right of electing either to take under the will or of renouncing the will and taking under the law of descent and distribution. ” In the case at bar the facts pertaining to this aspect of the case are not in dispute. The will was probated August 7, 1968. The record reflects that actually two renunciations were filed. One renunciation was certified by the Clerk of the Letcher County Court ( erroneously designated as Clerk of the Letcher Circuit Court ) to have been acknowledged by Ruth and filed on the _ day of August, 1972 ( sic ). A notation at the top of the document indicates that it may have been filed September 13, 1972. The other renunciation was certified by the Clerk of the Letcher County Court to have been acknowledged by Ruth on October 2, 1972, and filed on September 29, 1972, which was three days prior to its acknowledgment. Regardless of whether the renunciation was executed or filed in August, September or October, 1972, the filing was more than twelve months after the probate of the will. As a matter of fact, the filing of the renunciation in any event was at least four years after the probate of Carl ’ s will. KRS 392. 080 deals with the renunciation of a will by a surviving spouse. To paraphrase the statute, we find that Ruth would have had to file her renunciation by August 7, 1969. This, she did not do. This court has held that if a widow fails to renounce the will of her husband making provision for her, she must take the estate given by the will. Moise v. Moise ’ s Ex ’ r, 302 Ky. 843, 196 S. W. 2d 607 ( 1946 ) ; Huhlien v. Huhlien, 87 Ky. 247, 8 S. W. 260 ( 1888 ) ; Smith et ux. v. Bone etc., 70 Ky. 367, 7 Bush 367 ( 1870 ) ; Chenault v. Scott, 23 Ky. Law Rep. 1974, 66 S. W. 759 ( 1902 ). Furthermore, in Mercer v. Smith, 32 Ky. 1003, 107 S. W. 1196 ( 1908 ), we held that a widow may not appeal from the order probating her husband ’ s will. If she does not approve of its provisions, under the express terms of Ky. St. 1903, § 1404 ( now KRS 392. - * 233080 ), she may renounce them and take under the law ; that being an exclusive remedy by which she can obtain her legal rights as her husband ’ s widow. If Ruth were permitted., to proceed with her will contest ( No. 4771 ) and succeed in having the will set aside and held for naught, she would then share in Carl ’ s estate as if he had died intestate. To accomplish the same result, all she had to do was to file a renunciation of his will and she would have received her share as if he had made no will. The difficulty in which Ruth finds herself in the instant case is that she waited over four years to file a renunciation. This is of her own doing, and she will have to make the best of it. The trial judge properly dismissed the action. We next turn our attention to the action in which Ruth challenges the September 23, 1968, settlement with Clarence Harlow ( No. 4772 ). The trial judge sustained a motion for summary judgment. The complaint was filed by Ruth as widow of Carl and as administratrix of his estate. The defendants therein are Clarence Harlow, Harlow Motor Company, Harlow Motor Company, Inc., Universal C. I. T. Corporation, Ford Motor Company, First Security Bank, Bank of Neon, Bill Harlow and Kenneth Harlow. The complaint charged that the “ receipt and release of claim ” was procured from her under duress, fraud and deceit. The allegations of the complaint are duly put in issue by Clarence ’ s answer. The ten - page complaint sets out with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud and the relationship of each of the codefendants to the subject matter of the action. None of the code - fendants are charged with the commission of the fraud, duress or deceit. This charge is directed at Clarence Harlow alone. Bill Harlow and Kenneth Harlow are the sons of Ruth and Carl, and they are made parties so that the action could be fully and finally disposed of. All of the other defendants are made parties by reason of the fact that they may have certain information and records which Ruth contends she may need in the establishment of her claim. The mere fact that a party may possess information which is pertinent to the action does not justify inclusion as a party to the action. No right to any relief has been sought against any person other than Clarence Harlow, Harlow Motor Company and Harlow Motor Company, Inc. All information and records legally pertinent to the issue can be properly secured by the taking of depositions. A record may reflect grave doubt that a claimant may prosecute his action to a successful conclusion, but he should be permitted at least to try. He should not be compelled to try his action on a motion for summary judgment. The true purpose of a summary judgment is to terminate litigation when, as a matter of law, it appears that it would be impossible for the respondent to produce evidence at trial warranting a judgment in his favor against the movant. Roberson v. Lampton, Ky., 516 S. W. 2d 838 ( 1974 ). Such is not the case here. The trial judge erroneously sustained defendant ’ s motion for a summary judgment insofar as it dismissed Ruth ’ s action against Clarence Harlow, Harlow Motor Company, Harlow Motor Company, Inc., and her two sons, Bill and Kenneth Harlow. Insofar as the court dismissed the action against Universal C. I. T. Corporation, Ford Motor Company, First Security Bank and Bank of Neon, it acted properly. The judgment is affirmed insofar as it dismissed the attempted appeal from the order probating the will of Carl Harlow ( No. 4771 ) and reversed insofar as it dismissed Ruth ’ s attack upon the September 23, 1968, settlement ( No. 4772 ).

3800220_1,7759,"STATEMENT OF FACTS. The plaintiffs in error are non - residents of the Territory of Oklahoma and owners of large herds of cattle that were kept and grazed, during a portion of the year 1895, in parts of the Osage Indian reservation in this territory. The defendants in error are the board of county commissioners, treasurer and sheriff of Kay county, Oklahoma Territory. * Page 4 On the third Monday in February, 1894, the supreme court of the Territory of Oklahoma, by an order entered on the journals of said court, attached to said county of Kay, for judicial purposes, all the Kaw or Kansas Indian reservation and all of the Osage Indian reservation, north of the township line dividing townships 25 and 26, north. All of said reservations, so attached to said Kay county, for judicial purposes, by such order, are without the boundaries of said Kay county, as established by the secretary of the interior, and are not within the boundaries of any organized county of this territory. Said territory, so attached to said county of Kay, for judicial purposes, is comprised wholly of lands owned and occupied by Indian tribes and consists, principally, of wild, unimproved and unallotted lands, used for grazing purposes ; that plaintiffs in error, during the year 1895, and during the month of April of said year, drove, transported and shipped to the ranges and pastures in that part of said Osage Indian reservation, attached to said Kay county, for judicial purposes, as aforesaid, large herds and numbers of cattle, which were taken on to said reservation in pursuance of and by virtue and authority of certain leases to plaintiffs in error, for grazing purposes, made by the Osage tribal government under the supervision of the agent in charge of said tribe, and upon the ratification and approval of the commissioner of Indian affairs and of the secretary of the interior. And said cattle of said plaintiffs in error were, on the first day of May, kept and grazed on that part of said Indian reservation attached to said Kay county, for judicial purposes, as aforesaid. By an act approved March 5, 1895 the legislative assembly of the Territory of Oklahoma amended § 13, art. 2, ch. 7 of the Oklahoma Statutes, relating to revenue, * Page 5 so that the same reads as follows : "" That when any cattle are kept or grazed or any other personal property is situated in any unorganized country, district or reservation of this territory, such property shall be subject to taxation in the organized county to which said country, district or reservation is attached for judicial purposes, "" and authorized the board of county commissioners of the organized county or counties to which such unorganized country, district or reservation is attached, to appoint a special assessor each year, whose duty it should be to assess such property, and conferred upon such special assessor all the powers and required him to perform all the duties of a township assessor. The assessor so provided for was required to begin and perform his duties between the first day of April and the twenty - fifth day of May of each year, and to complete his duties and return his tax lists on or before June 1, and the property therein authorized to be assessed, it was provided, should be valued as of May 1, each year. In pursuance of the provisions of said act the county commissioners of said Kay county did duly appoint a special assessor for the year 1895, to assess such cattle as were kept and grazed, and any other personal property situated in the unorganized country and parts of Indian reservations attached to said Kay county for judicial purposes, and said special assessor did, by virtue of said appointment, assess all the personal property in the territory so attached to the county of Kay for judicial purposes, including all of the cattle of the said plaintiffs in error kept and grazed in said reservation on the first day of May, 1895. The said special assessor assessed the property of these plaintiffs in error so located on said territory attached to said county of Kay for judicial purposes * Page 6 as aforesaid, and returned the same upon an assessment roll at the total valuation of $ 760, 469 ; that thereafter the said sum was, by the clerk of said county, carried into the aggregate assessment for said county, and by him certified to the auditor of the territory ; that the territorial board of equalization, in acting upon the various assessments of the various counties, as certified to said board, raised the aggregate valuation of the property returned for taxation upon the tax rolls of said county of Kay, 35 per cent, and the county clerk for said county carried out the raised valuation so certified to him by said territorial board of equalization against the property of these plaintiffs in error, and made the aggregate valuation of such property $ 1, 026, 634. Thereafter the territorial board of equalization levied and duly certified to the county clerk of the county of Kay tax levies, for territorial purposes for the year 1895, as follows : General revenue, three mills on the dollar. University fund, one - half mill on the dollar. Normal school fund, one - half mill on the dollar. Bond interest fund, one - half mill on the dollar. Board of education fund, one - half mill on the dollar. That the board of county commissioners for the county of Kay made the following levies for the year 1895 : For salaries, five mills on the dollar. For contingent expenses, three mills on the dollar. For sinking fund, one and one - half mills on the dollar. For court expenses, two and one - half mills on the dollar. For county supplies, three mills on the dollar. For road and bridge fund, two mills on the dollar. For poor fund of said county, one mill on the dollar. For county school fund of said county, one mill on the dollar. * Page 7 The county clerk of said county of Kay carried the valuation of the property of these plaintiffs in error upon the tax rolls of said county and against the same extended the levies as aforesaid and charged against the property of these plaintiffs in error in the aggregate the sum of $ 26, 174. 16. Before these taxes became delinquent, plaintiffs in error began to remove or attempted to remove their respective property from the territory attached to Kay county for judicial purposes, and beyond the limits of Oklahoma Territory. The treasurer of said Kay county issued tax warrants for the several amounts of taxes levied against the property of each of said plaintiffs in error and delivered the same to the sheriff of said county for execution. Said sheriff seized certain property of each of plaintiffs in error by virtue of such tax warrants. The plaintiffs in error filed their several petitions in the district court of Kay county and on application obtained injunctions, restraining the defendants in error from making any further attempt to collect such taxes. Afterwards, on motion, the several actions were consolidated into one. To the petition, filed in such consolidated action, the defendants in error filed a general demurrer. At the hearing the district court sustained the demurrer in part and overruled it in part, holding that all of the levies made for territorial purposes and the county levy for court expenses, were valid ; and as to those levies, the injunction was dissolved, and as to all of the other county levies, such injunctions were made perpetual. From that part of the order and judgment of the court dissolving the injunction as to the territorial taxes and the one county fund levy, plaintiffs appealed. From that part perpetuating the injunction as to all of the county levies, * Page 8 except that for court expenses, the defendants appealed, and filed their cross - petition in error, and the case is thus here for review. The opinion of the court was delivered by The questions involved are of great public and private interest and have received from us that very careful consideration and attention which their importance demands. By § 6 of the Organic Act of the territory, it is provided : "" That the legislative power of the territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation, not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the United States, but no law shall be passed interfering with the primary disposal of the soil ; no tax shall be imposed on the property of the United States nor shall the lands or other property of non - residents be taxed higher than the lands or other property of residents, nor shall any law be passed impairing the right to private property, nor shall any unequal discrimination be made in taxing different kinds of property, but all property subject to taxation shall be taxed in proportion to its value. "" * * A broader grant of legislative power than that contained in this section could hardly be conceived of. This Organic Act of the territory defined its boundaries, created a government which comprised a legislative department, vested with power of legislating upon all rightful subjects of legislation and co - extensive with the exterior boundaries of the territory. The taxing power * Page 9 is a part of the legislative power of government and taxation is a rightful subject of legislation. Taxes are the enforced contributions upon persons or property levied by the government by virtue of its sovereignty for the support of government and for public needs. The citizen pays from his property the portion demanded in order that by means thereof he may be secured in the enjoyment of the benefits of organized society. The power is unlimited in its reach as to subjects ; in its very nature, it acknowledges no limit ; it is sometimes said that in its exercise it may become a power to confiscate or destroy, but this must be thus qualified, that under our system of constitutional governments it differs from the forced contributions, loans and benevolences of arbitrary and tyrannical governments. It is not an arbitrary power, nor can it be exercised capriciously. It is hedged about and restricted by wise constitutional limitations and fixed general rules. These constitutional limitations and general rules are designed to secure a just apportionment of the burdens of government by requiring uniformity of contributions, levied by fixed general rule, and apportioned by the law according to some uniform measure of equality. Within these rules and limitations the authority and power of the legislative department is absolute and conclusive. The ends sought to be reached by these general and fundamental rules and constitutional restrictions upon upon the powers of taxation are equality, uniformity and justice in apportioning the burdens of government ; but as the idea of exact equality, uniformity and justice under any system of human laws being attainable is Utopian, it is not expected that such exactness can be attained in the * Page 10 exercise of the powers of taxation. Notwithstanding such fixed general rules and limitations, the discretion of the legislature is very broad and its exercise may work injustice and oppression. If such discretionary power be threatened with abuse, security must be found in the responsibility of the legislature that imposes the tax to the constituency that elected them. The judicial cannot prescribe to the legislative department of the government limitations upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers. The power to tax may be exercised oppressively upon persons or with regard to property, but if it do not clearly violate some established rule of limitation, the responsibility of the legislature is not to the courts but to the people by whom its members are elected. The courts can only interfere when the conclusion is unavoidable, that the legislature has transcended its powers or clearly violated some constitutional or other fixed general ruling defining or limiting such power. ( Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 548 ; Weston v. Charleston, 2 Peters, 449 - 466 ; Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 ; Tallman v. Butler, 12 Iowa, 531. ) Our inquiry then is, did the legislature, by the act of 1895, under authority of which the taxes in controversy were assessed and levied, transcend its powers, and is such act a violation of any constitutional or other fixed general rule controlling the discretion of the legislature? The only limitation or restriction upon the taxing power of the legislature, which I find in the Organic Act for the territory is that contained in § 6 of said act, which is as follows : "" No tax shall be imposed on the property of the United States, nor shall the lands or other property of non - residents be taxed higher than the lands or other property of residents, nor shall any law be passed impairing * Page 11 the right to private property, nor shall any unequal discrimination be made in taxing different kinds of property, but all property subject to taxation shall be taxed in proportion to its value. "" And the following provision in § 1 of said act. "" Provided, that nothing in this act shall be construed to impair any right now pertaining to any Indians or Indian tribe in said territory under the laws, agreements and treaties of the United States, or to impair the rights of person or property pertaining to said Indians, or to affect the authority of the government of the United States to make any regulation or to make any law respecting said Indians, their lands, property or other rights which it would have been competent to make or enact if this act had not been passed. "" If, therefore, there be any restriction or limitation upon the power of the legislature to tax the property of plaintiffs or which makes such taxation invalid, it must be found in these provisions of the Organic Act or in the constitution, treaties or legislation of the United States, or some general rule inherent in our system of government. It is not contended that the act under which these taxes are sought to be imposed is obnoxious to any provision of the Federal constitution, but it is contended by plaintiffs that the legislature has no jurisdiction to enact laws, especially tax laws, and put the same in force in these Indian reservations. The argument being that although these reservations are within the exterior boundaries of Oklahoma Territory, yet they comprise no part of the territory for territorial governmental purposes, but are exclusively under the jurisdiction of the United States, and that the legislative power of the territory does not extend over them. It is conceded by counsel for plaintiffs that the treaty under which the Osage Indians were settled on these lands contained no * Page 12 provision or stipulation by which said Indian tribe or the lands occupied by them were not, without their consent, to be included within the limits or jurisdiction of any state or territory that might thereafter be created and which should include such reservation within its exterior boundaries. That there was at the time the Organic Act, creating the Territory of Oklahoma, was passed, and at the time the act of 1895, authorizing the taxation in controversy was enacted, and at the time these taxes were assessed and levied, no treaty with the Osage Indian tribe that the lands or any part thereof, within this reservation, should be thus excluded from the limits and jurisdiction of any state or territory. I think there is no proposition better settled by authorities than that, in the absence of such treaty stipulation, the authority of the territory may rightfully extend over such reservation in all matters of rightful legislation, not interfering with the persons and property of the Indians within such reservation, under the protection of the laws and authority of the United States ; and that as to all matters and subjects of rightful legislation, not interfering with that protection, and not otherwise repugnant to the constitution and laws of the United States, the legislative power of the territory is absolute. ( Utah Northern Railway v. Fisher, 116 U. S. 28 ; Langford v. Monteith, 102 U. S. 145 ; Ph œnix and Maricopa R. R. Co., v. Arizona Territory, Sup. Court of Ariz. 26 Pac. Rep. 310, Maricopa Ph œnix R. R. Co., v. Ariz. Ter. 156 U. S. 347 ; Torrey v. Baldwin, 26 Pac. Rep. 908 ; Gon - Shay - ee petitioner 130 U. S. 343 ; Ex parte Crow Dog 109 U. S. 556 - 560 ; United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375 ; United States v. Pridgeon, 153 U. S. 48. ) This doctrine was distinctly held by this court in Keokuk v. Ulam, 4 Okla. Rep. 5, 38 Pac. Rep. 1083. * Page 13 The contention of plaintiffs upon this proposition would seem to be based upon reasonings and authorities which are not applicable. Their contention seems to be that these reservations are to be considered as exclusively under the jurisdiction of the United States, the same as lands purchased by the United States within the boundaries of states, and with the consent of said states for the purposes of forts, arsenals, magazines, navy yards, dock yards, etc. If this contention were correct, then it would be supported by all the authorities and would prevail, for I concede it to be uncontroverted that property situated wholly within boundaries exclusively within the jurisdiction of the United States, cannot be taxed by the state or territory within which it may be situated ; but these reservations are not within boundaries exclusively within the jurisdiction of the United States, for the reason that congress in § 6 of the Organic Act of this territory delegated to the government of the territory legislative power extending to all rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the United States within the exterior boundaries of the territory created by that act, which includes the reservation which is the locus of this controversy ; that the jurisdiction conferred upon the territory is not exclusive ; that congress has reserved to itself jurisdiction over the persons and lands of the Indians occupying the reservation, does not diminish or restrict the authority of the territory to legislate concerning the persons and property of citizens of the United States therein. It was the duty of the territorial legislature to apportion the burdens of government upon all property within the territory not withdrawn from its jurisdiction by the Organic Act or other laws of the United States or not otherwise exempted from such * Page 14 burden by law. The property of the plaintiff comprised a part of the mass of property within the territory which was receiving the protection of its laws and which might lawfully be and should justly be subjected to taxation. And the right to subject such property to taxation, under the conditions and the situation in which plaintiff ' s property was, has not been denied by any court, but has been upheld in numerous instances. ( Utah Northern Ry. v. Fisher, 116 U. S. 28 ; Torrey v. Baldwin, 26 Pac. Rep. 908 ; Ph œnix Maricopa R. R. Co. v. Ter. Ariz. 26 Pac. Rep. 310 ; Ferris v. Vennier, 6 Dak. — 42 N. W. Rep. 34 ; Marico Ph œnix R. R. Co. v. Ariz. Ter. 156 U. S. 347. ) In Torrey v. Baldwin, 26 Pac. Rep. 908, supra, the supreme court of Wyoming held that the treaty of July 3, 1868, with the Shoshones, pursuant to which their reservation was established, contained no reservation or exception whereby it should be excluded and excepted out of the territory within which it was situated, and that the reservation was included within the territory, and that cattle thereon belonging to a white person, in no wise connected with the Indians, were subject to taxation in the county within which the reservation lay. In Phoenix and Maricopa Railroad company v. Arizona Territory, supra, the supreme court of Arizona held that in the absence of treaty or other express exclusions the different Indian reservations became a part of the territory where situate, and subject to territorial legislative jurisdiction, subject, however, to the powers of the general government to make regulations respecting the Indians, their property, etc., and that a railroad built across an Indian reservation in the territory is subject to taxation by the territory where there * Page 15 are no treaty stipulations or express exclusions against the jurisdiction of the territory ; and this decision was, on appeal, affirmed by the supreme court of the United States in 156 U. S. 347, supra. In Utah Northern Railway v. Fisher, 116 U. S. 31, Mr. Justice Field says : "" The authority of the territory may rightfully extend to all matters not interfering with that protection. ( Protection of Indians and their property ). It has therefore been held that process of its courts may run into an Indian reservation of this kind where the subject matter or controversy is otherwise within their cognizance. If the plaintiff lawfully constructed and now operates a railroad through the reservation, it is not perceived that any just rights of the Indians under the treaty can be impaired by taxing the road and property used in operating it. "" A further contention of the plaintiffs is : That this reservation, under the statutes of the United States, has been leased by the Osage Nation or tribe for grazing purposes and that the taxation of cattle kept and grazed upon said reservation is a direct tax upon the right of the Indians to lease the same, and decreases to the extent of the tax the value of the Indian lands ; that the act authorizing such taxation is in direct derogation of the property rights of the Indians upon such reservation and is therefore void. This proposition is without merit and certainly is unsupported by authority. The authority upon which plaintiffs rely to support this contention is the case of Pollock v. the Farmers ' Loan and Trust company, 157 U. S. 429, known as the "" Income Tax "" case. Counsel in their brief quote from Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, on page 555 in the report of that case, as follows : "" The contention of the plaintiff is, first, that the law in qustion in imposing a tax upon the income of rents * Page 16 of real estate imposes a tax upon the real estate itself ; and in imposing a tax upon the interest or income of bonds or other personal property held for the purpose of income, or ordinarily yielding income, imposes a tax upon the personal estate itself ; that such tax is a direct tax and void because imposed without regard to the rule of apportionment, and that by reason thereof the whole law is invalid. "" It is true that that contention was sustained by a majority of a divided court in that case, but I am unable to perceive its application to the principles of the case at bar. The contention was sustained in that case, because it was held that a tax upon the income or rents of real estate imposed a tax upon the real estate itself ; that it was therefore a direct tax, and that being such it was obnoxious to the provision of the constitution prohibiting the levy of direct taxes except by apportionment among the several states. It would not be seriously contended that that provision of the Federal constitution prescribed a rule operative upon any other legislative authority than the congress of the United States, or in the raising of revenue for the support of any government, other than the Federal government ; but even if such contention should be made, the principle of the case cited is not broad enough to cover the proposition submitted by counsel for plaintiffs. The taxation we are considering was not assessed or levied upon the real estate or other property of the Indians occupying this reservation nor upon the income or rents of such Indians derived from such real estate or other property ; this tax is not levied upon the rents which are paid to these Indians under their leases to the plaintiffs, but it is levied upon the property of the plaintiffs in which the Indians have no interest. The argument that taxation upon * Page 17 property brought into this reservation for the purpose of grazing upon Indian lands is an additional servitude that decreases the salable value of the land, and that it operates in fixing the rental value of these lands to the same extent it would, if made a tax upon the land itself, is scarcely less remote than to say that the tariffs which these cattle owners have to pay to railroad corporations for transporting their cattle out of these reservations to market is an additional servitude, that decreases the rental value of the lands of the Indians ; or, that the taxation of the personal property of a tenant is an added servitude on the freehold of the landlord. I do not think the act of the legislature providing for this taxation, in any manner, impairs the property rights of the Indians occupying this reservation. Another contention of the plaintiffs is that this taxation is unconstitutional and void because it rests upon the attempt of the supreme court of the territory to fix taxing districts, which is a legislative function. The answer to this proposition is that the supreme court of the territory has not attempted to fix any taxing districts ; that that court, under the powers expressly vested in it by the Organic Act of the territory, in 1894, attached this reservation and unorganized country to Kay county for judicial purposes, and not for the purposes of taxation ; that the taxing districts in which these taxes were imposed and levied were created and fixed, not by the supreme court, but by the legislature, in the act of 1895 ; the language of the act being : "" That when any cattle are kept or grazed or any other personal property is situated in any unorganized country, district or reservation of this territory, that such property shall be subject to taxation in the organized * Page 18 county to which said country, district or reservation is attached for judicial purposes. "" It was by this act that a taxing district was created and not by the order of the court. Another objection which plaintiffs make against the legality of this tax is, that the act attempting to authorize it only applies to personal property ; that no provision is made for the taxing of real estate in such reservation ; that it is a discrimination in taxing different kinds of property, and therefore in conflict with the Organic Act. This court will take judicial knowledge of the public treaties of the United States ; and from such treaties the court has judicial knowledge that the title to all the lands within this Indian reservation is in the Indian tribe, or in the United States for the use of said Indian tribe. The power of taxation possessed by the territorial government not extending to the taxing of the property of the United States, or of the Indian wards of the United States, there is no taxable real estate in said reservation, and consequently the act does not discriminate as between different kinds of property subject to taxation, there not being different kinds of property subject to taxation in such reservation. The most serious contention of the plaintiffs that confronts us in this matter is, that the act under which these taxes were assessed and levied is void for the reason that it attempts to tax property situated in these Indian reservations for the benefit of the counties to which they are attached for judicial purposes, the owners and holders of property on these Indian reservations, it being claimed, having no interest in the taxes gathered by said counties, no voice in their expenditure nor benefit * Page 19 therefrom, said Indian reservations not being within the geographical boundaries of said counties ; that the taxing of the owners of said property by such counties is taking the property of the persons holding said property on said reservation for the benefit of the residents of said county and is, therefore, taking private property for private uses. It is argued that plaintiffs have no interest in the purposes for which these taxes are to be expended and will derive no benefit from their expenditure ; that the moneys derived from this taxation under the county levy will all be expended within the organized county of Kay ; that plaintiffs are non - residents of the territory, and that neither they or their property are within said county of Kay, and therefore cannot be benefitted by the expenditure of moneys apportioned and used for the salary fund, contingent expense fund, sinking fund, court expense fund, county supplies fund, road and bridge fund, poor fund or county school fund of said county. We have been cited to or been able to find but one authority directly in point upon the proposition as presented in this case. In the case of Ferris v. Vennier, 42 N. W. Rep. 34, the supreme court of Dakota Territory, in a case similar to this in all particulars, save that the attached territory was not an Indian reservation but was an unorganized territory, held the levy for territorial purposes to be valid and those for county purposes to be invalid. There are a number of authorities upon analogous cases, but such authorities are conflicting. The greater number of authorities presented by counsel for plaintiffs in their brief upon this proposition relate to cases of special assessments for local improvement, such as the construction of highways, streets, pavements, * Page 20 sewers, etc., where the benefits are peculiar to a limited district or locality, and this class of cases have always been held distinct in principle from that which we are considering and the right to impose such taxes has always been held to be founded upon and to be governed by different principles from those embraced in public taxation for ordinary public or governmental purposes. Bearing upon the case at bar, is the case of Wells v. The City of Weston, 22 Mo. 384, in which the court held that, "" The legislature cannot authorize a municipal corporation to tax for its own local purposes land lying beyond the corporate limits. "" In Cheaney v. Hooser, 9 Ben Monroe, 341, the court held that the extension of the limits of one town so as to include the adjacent lands of another town against or without the consent of the owners and subject the property and people within the added territory to the jurisdiction and taxing powers of the extended municipal government without the consent of the added population, is, in effect, taking private property for public use. In Sharpless v. Mayor of Philadelphia, 21 Penn. State, 172, the court said : "" By taxation, is meant a certain mode of raising revenue for a public purpose in which the community that pays it has an interest ; but to make a tax law unconstitutional on this ground, it must be apparent at the first blush that the community taxed can have no possible interest in the purpose to which their money is to be applied. And this is more especially true if it be a local tax, and if the local authorities have themselves laid the tax in pursuance of an act of the assembly. "" In a case in Tennessee, Taylor, McBean Co., v. William R. Chandler et al, 9 Heiskall, 349, the court * Page 21 said : "" A state burden cannot be placed upon any territory less than the entire state, nor a county burden upon territory greater or smaller than the county. "" In the case of Washington Avenue, 69 Penn. State, 361, the learned judge delivering the opinion says : "" I admit that the powers to tax is unbounded by any express limit in the constitution ; that it may be exercised to the full extent of the public exigency. I concede that it differs from the power of eminent domain and has no thought of compensation by way of a return for that which is taken and applied to the public good, further than all derive benefit from the purpose to which it is applied. "" In Morford v. Unger, 8 Iowa, 82, the court said : "" The extension of the limits of a city or town so as to include its actual enlargement as manifested by houses and population, is to be deemed a legitimate exercise of legislative power. An indefinite or unreasonable extension, so as to embrace lands and farms that are distant from the local government, does not rest upon the same authority. And although it may be a delicate, as well as a difficult duty for the judiciary to interpose, we have no doubt but that there are limits beyond which the legislative discretion cannot go. "" Kelley v. The City of Pittsburg, 104 U. S. 658, was a case wherein the city of Pittsburg, under an act of the legislature, extended the city limits so as to include the plaintiff ' s farm, and assessed the same as other property in the city was assessed for street tax, school tax, etc. The court, in sustaining the validity of the extension, said : "" We cannot say, judicially, that Mr. Kelley received no benefit from the city organization. These streets, if they do not penetrate his farm, lead to it. The waterworks will probably reach him some day and may be near enough him now to serve on some occasions. The schools may receive his children and in this regard he * Page 22 can be in no worse condition than those living in the city having no children and who pay for the support of the schools. Every man in a county, a town, a city, a state, is deeply interested in the education of the children of the community, because his peace and quiet, his happiness and prosperity, are largely dependent upon the intelligence and moral training which it is the object of the public schools to supply to the children of his neighbors and associates, if he has none himself. The police government, the officers whose duty it is to punish and prevent crime, are paid out of the taxes. Has he no interest in their protection, because he lives farther from the court house and the police station than the others? Clearly, these are matters of detail within the legislative discretion and, therefore, of power in the lawmaking body within whose jurisdiction the parties live. This court cannot say in such cases, however great the hardships or unequal the burden, that the tax collected for such purposes, is taking the property of the taxpayers, without due process of law. "" I might multiply citations from conflicting authorities like these, without finding any rule to guide or definitely determine where the line can be drawn which determines, in cases like this, the limit of legislative discretion. Nearly, if not all, these cases arose to test the extent and limit of authority in subordinate agencies of the state, like municipal corporations, and not the discretion vested in the legislature of the state. No court has yet attempted to define, specifically, the benefits that a taxpayer must receive from government, in order to make valid the public taxes taken from him. True, in theory, taxation should be equal, not only in its burdens, but in its benefits, but this equality is never attained. No one questions the right of a commonwealth to tax the property of non - residents within its borders ; yet, such non - residents do not stand upon a basis of equality in the benefits * Page 23 of the government that imposes the tax. They may, or may not, receive particular benefits from its courts, its schools, the improvement of its public highways, or from any of the other purposes to which its revenues are appropriated. But such benefits are never a test of the liability of their property to taxation. The plaintiffs in this case might have their herds of cattle within the limits of Kay county and receive no greater benefit in the protection of the law than they do now ; yet, they would not be heard to assert that such property should not be taxed for the various county purposes to which taxation is appropriated. The counties, cities and towns of this territory are not independent or distinct governments from that of the territory. They are a part of that government ; they are the instrumentalities and agencies through which the territorial government promotes the welfare of its inhabitants and through which the territory is better enabled to protect the lives and liberties of its inhabitants and the property that is within its borders, whether that of its own citizens or that of non - residents. The nearer these purposes are attained, the greater are the benefits to these plaintiffs, as well as to all others having property subject to the protection of its laws. Laws similar to this, attaching unorganized remote territory to municipal townships in the state of Michigan, were for years maintained and enforced ; and though the taxes gathered from the attached territory was appropriated and expended for the purposes of the township to which it was attached, I do not find that their validity was ever directly called into question. ( Roscommon v. Midland, 39 Mich. 424 ; Township of Comins v. Township of Harrisville, 45 Mich. 442. ) * Page 24 In this last case the facts found by the court were that from the year 1869 until March, 1877, the county of Oscoda was attached to the county of Alcona for judicial and municipal purposes, and up to the last named date, the township of Harrisville, in said Alcona county, exercised municipal jurisdiction over the territory comprising the unorganized county of Oscoda. That, in 1877, the legislature organized the county of Oscoda into a township called by the act creating it, "" The Township of Comins. "" In that year, and after the passage of said act, but before said township of Comins had been fully organized by the election of township officers, the township of Harrisville made an assessment roll embracing, with other territory, all the territory in the county of Oscoda, and the taxes thus assessed were collected by the officers of the township of Harrisville.",3800220," STATEMENT OF FACTS. The plaintiffs in error are non-residents of the Territory of Oklahoma and owners of large herds of cattle that were kept and grazed, during a portion of the year 1895, in parts of the Osage Indian reservation in this territory. The defendants in error are the board of county commissioners, treasurer and sheriff of Kay county, Oklahoma Territory. *Page 4 On the third Monday in February, 1894, the supreme court of the Territory of Oklahoma, by an order entered on the journals of said court, attached to said county of Kay, for judicial purposes, all the Kaw or Kansas Indian reservation and all of the Osage Indian reservation, north of the township line dividing townships 25 and 26, north. All of said reservations, so attached to said Kay county, for judicial purposes, by such order, are without the boundaries of said Kay county, as established by the secretary of the interior, and are not within the boundaries of any organized county of this territory. Said territory, so attached to said county of Kay, for judicial purposes, is comprised wholly of lands owned and occupied by Indian tribes and consists, principally, of wild, unimproved and unallotted lands, used for grazing purposes; that plaintiffs in error, during the year 1895, and during the month of April of said year, drove, transported and shipped to the ranges and pastures in that part of said Osage Indian reservation, attached to said Kay county, for judicial purposes, as aforesaid, large herds and numbers of cattle, which were taken on to said reservation in pursuance of and by virtue and authority of certain leases to plaintiffs in error, for grazing purposes, made by the Osage tribal government under the supervision of the agent in charge of said tribe, and upon the ratification and approval of the commissioner of Indian affairs and of the secretary of the interior. And said cattle of said plaintiffs in error were, on the first day of May, kept and grazed on that part of said Indian reservation attached to said Kay county, for judicial purposes, as aforesaid. By an act approved March 5, 1895 the legislative assembly of the Territory of Oklahoma amended § 13, art. 2, ch. 7 of the Oklahoma Statutes, relating to revenue, *Page 5 so that the same reads as follows: ""That when any cattle are kept or grazed or any other personal property is situated in any unorganized country, district or reservation of this territory, such property shall be subject to taxation in the organized county to which said country, district or reservation is attached for judicial purposes,"" and authorized the board of county commissioners of the organized county or counties to which such unorganized country, district or reservation is attached, to appoint a special assessor each year, whose duty it should be to assess such property, and conferred upon such special assessor all the powers and required him to perform all the duties of a township assessor. The assessor so provided for was required to begin and perform his duties between the first day of April and the twenty-fifth day of May of each year, and to complete his duties and return his tax lists on or before June 1, and the property therein authorized to be assessed, it was provided, should be valued as of May 1, each year. In pursuance of the provisions of said act the county commissioners of said Kay county did duly appoint a special assessor for the year 1895, to assess such cattle as were kept and grazed, and any other personal property situated in the unorganized country and parts of Indian reservations attached to said Kay county for judicial purposes, and said special assessor did, by virtue of said appointment, assess all the personal property in the territory so attached to the county of Kay for judicial purposes, including all of the cattle of the said plaintiffs in error kept and grazed in said reservation on the first day of May, 1895. The said special assessor assessed the property of these plaintiffs in error so located on said territory attached to said county of Kay for judicial purposes *Page 6 as aforesaid, and returned the same upon an assessment roll at the total valuation of $760,469; that thereafter the said sum was, by the clerk of said county, carried into the aggregate assessment for said county, and by him certified to the auditor of the territory; that the territorial board of equalization, in acting upon the various assessments of the various counties, as certified to said board, raised the aggregate valuation of the property returned for taxation upon the tax rolls of said county of Kay, 35 per cent, and the county clerk for said county carried out the raised valuation so certified to him by said territorial board of equalization against the property of these plaintiffs in error, and made the aggregate valuation of such property $1,026,634. Thereafter the territorial board of equalization levied and duly certified to the county clerk of the county of Kay tax levies, for territorial purposes for the year 1895, as follows: General revenue, three mills on the dollar. University fund, one-half mill on the dollar. Normal school fund, one-half mill on the dollar. Bond interest fund, one-half mill on the dollar. Board of education fund, one-half mill on the dollar. That the board of county commissioners for the county of Kay made the following levies for the year 1895: For salaries, five mills on the dollar. For contingent expenses, three mills on the dollar. For sinking fund, one and one-half mills on the dollar. For court expenses, two and one-half mills on the dollar. For county supplies, three mills on the dollar. For road and bridge fund, two mills on the dollar. For poor fund of said county, one mill on the dollar. For county school fund of said county, one mill on the dollar. *Page 7 The county clerk of said county of Kay carried the valuation of the property of these plaintiffs in error upon the tax rolls of said county and against the same extended the levies as aforesaid and charged against the property of these plaintiffs in error in the aggregate the sum of $26,174.16. Before these taxes became delinquent, plaintiffs in error began to remove or attempted to remove their respective property from the territory attached to Kay county for judicial purposes, and beyond the limits of Oklahoma Territory. The treasurer of said Kay county issued tax warrants for the several amounts of taxes levied against the property of each of said plaintiffs in error and delivered the same to the sheriff of said county for execution. Said sheriff seized certain property of each of plaintiffs in error by virtue of such tax warrants. The plaintiffs in error filed their several petitions in the district court of Kay county and on application obtained injunctions, restraining the defendants in error from making any further attempt to collect such taxes. Afterwards, on motion, the several actions were consolidated into one. To the petition, filed in such consolidated action, the defendants in error filed a general demurrer. At the hearing the district court sustained the demurrer in part and overruled it in part, holding that all of the levies made for territorial purposes and the county levy for court expenses, were valid; and as to those levies, the injunction was dissolved, and as to all of the other county levies, such injunctions were made perpetual. From that part of the order and judgment of the court dissolving the injunction as to the territorial taxes and the one county fund levy, plaintiffs appealed. From that part perpetuating the injunction as to all of the county levies, *Page 8 except that for court expenses, the defendants appealed, and filed their cross-petition in error, and the case is thus here for review. The opinion of the court was delivered by The questions involved are of great public and private interest and have received from us that very careful consideration and attention which their importance demands. By § 6 of the Organic Act of the territory, it is provided: ""That the legislative power of the territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation, not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the United States, but no law shall be passed interfering with the primary disposal of the soil; no tax shall be imposed on the property of the United States nor shall the lands or other property of non-residents be taxed higher than the lands or other property of residents, nor shall any law be passed impairing the right to private property, nor shall any unequal discrimination be made in taxing different kinds of property, but all property subject to taxation shall be taxed in proportion to its value."" * * A broader grant of legislative power than that contained in this section could hardly be conceived of. This Organic Act of the territory defined its boundaries, created a government which comprised a legislative department, vested with power of legislating upon all rightful subjects of legislation and co-extensive with the exterior boundaries of the territory. The taxing power *Page 9 is a part of the legislative power of government and taxation is a rightful subject of legislation. Taxes are the enforced contributions upon persons or property levied by the government by virtue of its sovereignty for the support of government and for public needs. The citizen pays from his property the portion demanded in order that by means thereof he may be secured in the enjoyment of the benefits of organized society. The power is unlimited in its reach as to subjects; in its very nature, it acknowledges no limit; it is sometimes said that in its exercise it may become a power to confiscate or destroy, but this must be thus qualified, that under our system of constitutional governments it differs from the forced contributions, loans and benevolences of arbitrary and tyrannical governments. It is not an arbitrary power, nor can it be exercised capriciously. It is hedged about and restricted by wise constitutional limitations and fixed general rules. These constitutional limitations and general rules are designed to secure a just apportionment of the burdens of government by requiring uniformity of contributions, levied by fixed general rule, and apportioned by the law according to some uniform measure of equality. Within these rules and limitations the authority and power of the legislative department is absolute and conclusive. The ends sought to be reached by these general and fundamental rules and constitutional restrictions upon upon the powers of taxation are equality, uniformity and justice in apportioning the burdens of government; but as the idea of exact equality, uniformity and justice under any system of human laws being attainable is Utopian, it is not expected that such exactness can be attained in the *Page 10 exercise of the powers of taxation. Notwithstanding such fixed general rules and limitations, the discretion of the legislature is very broad and its exercise may work injustice and oppression. If such discretionary power be threatened with abuse, security must be found in the responsibility of the legislature that imposes the tax to the constituency that elected them. The judicial cannot prescribe to the legislative department of the government limitations upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers. The power to tax may be exercised oppressively upon persons or with regard to property, but if it do not clearly violate some established rule of limitation, the responsibility of the legislature is not to the courts but to the people by whom its members are elected. The courts can only interfere when the conclusion is unavoidable, that the legislature has transcended its powers or clearly violated some constitutional or other fixed general ruling defining or limiting such power. ( Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 548 ; Weston v. Charleston, 2 Peters, 449 -466; Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 ; Tallman v. Butler, 12 Iowa, 531 .) Our inquiry then is, did the legislature, by the act of 1895, under authority of which the taxes in controversy were assessed and levied, transcend its powers, and is such act a violation of any constitutional or other fixed general rule controlling the discretion of the legislature? The only limitation or restriction upon the taxing power of the legislature, which I find in the Organic Act for the territory is that contained in § 6 of said act, which is as follows: ""No tax shall be imposed on the property of the United States, nor shall the lands or other property of non-residents be taxed higher than the lands or other property of residents, nor shall any law be passed impairing *Page 11 the right to private property, nor shall any unequal discrimination be made in taxing different kinds of property, but all property subject to taxation shall be taxed in proportion to its value."" And the following provision in § 1 of said act. ""Provided, that nothing in this act shall be construed to impair any right now pertaining to any Indians or Indian tribe in said territory under the laws, agreements and treaties of the United States, or to impair the rights of person or property pertaining to said Indians, or to affect the authority of the government of the United States to make any regulation or to make any law respecting said Indians, their lands, property or other rights which it would have been competent to make or enact if this act had not been passed."" If, therefore, there be any restriction or limitation upon the power of the legislature to tax the property of plaintiffs or which makes such taxation invalid, it must be found in these provisions of the Organic Act or in the constitution, treaties or legislation of the United States, or some general rule inherent in our system of government. It is not contended that the act under which these taxes are sought to be imposed is obnoxious to any provision of the Federal constitution, but it is contended by plaintiffs that the legislature has no jurisdiction to enact laws, especially tax laws, and put the same in force in these Indian reservations. The argument being that although these reservations are within the exterior boundaries of Oklahoma Territory, yet they comprise no part of the territory for territorial governmental purposes, but are exclusively under the jurisdiction of the United States, and that the legislative power of the territory does not extend over them. It is conceded by counsel for plaintiffs that the treaty under which the Osage Indians were settled on these lands contained no *Page 12 provision or stipulation by which said Indian tribe or the lands occupied by them were not, without their consent, to be included within the limits or jurisdiction of any state or territory that might thereafter be created and which should include such reservation within its exterior boundaries. That there was at the time the Organic Act, creating the Territory of Oklahoma, was passed, and at the time the act of 1895, authorizing the taxation in controversy was enacted, and at the time these taxes were assessed and levied, no treaty with the Osage Indian tribe that the lands or any part thereof, within this reservation, should be thus excluded from the limits and jurisdiction of any state or territory. I think there is no proposition better settled by authorities than that, in the absence of such treaty stipulation, the authority of the territory may rightfully extend over such reservation in all matters of rightful legislation, not interfering with the persons and property of the Indians within such reservation, under the protection of the laws and authority of the United States; and that as to all matters and subjects of rightful legislation, not interfering with that protection, and not otherwise repugnant to the constitution and laws of the United States, the legislative power of the territory is absolute. ( Utah Northern Railway v. Fisher, 116 U.S. 28 ; Langford v. Monteith, 102 U.S. 145 ; Ph œnix and Maricopa R. R. Co., v. Arizona Territory, Sup. Court of Ariz. 26 Pac. Rep. 310, Maricopa Ph œnix R. R. Co., v. Ariz. Ter . 156 U.S. 347 ; Torrey v. Baldwin, 26 Pac. Rep. 908; Gon-Shay-ee petitioner 130 U.S. 343 ; Ex parte Crow Dog 109 U.S. 556 -560; United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 ; United States v. Pridgeon, 153 U.S. 48 .) This doctrine was distinctly held by this court in Keokuk v. Ulam, 4 Okla. Rep. 5 , 38 Pac. Rep. 1083. *Page 13 The contention of plaintiffs upon this proposition would seem to be based upon reasonings and authorities which are not applicable. Their contention seems to be that these reservations are to be considered as exclusively under the jurisdiction of the United States, the same as lands purchased by the United States within the boundaries of states, and with the consent of said states for the purposes of forts, arsenals, magazines, navy yards, dock yards, etc. If this contention were correct, then it would be supported by all the authorities and would prevail, for I concede it to be uncontroverted that property situated wholly within boundaries exclusively within the jurisdiction of the United States, cannot be taxed by the state or territory within which it may be situated; but these reservations are not within boundaries exclusively within the jurisdiction of the United States, for the reason that congress in § 6 of the Organic Act of this territory delegated to the government of the territory legislative power extending to all rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the United States within the exterior boundaries of the territory created by that act, which includes the reservation which is the locus of this controversy; that the jurisdiction conferred upon the territory is not exclusive; that congress has reserved to itself jurisdiction over the persons and lands of the Indians occupying the reservation, does not diminish or restrict the authority of the territory to legislate concerning the persons and property of citizens of the United States therein. It was the duty of the territorial legislature to apportion the burdens of government upon all property within the territory not withdrawn from its jurisdiction by the Organic Act or other laws of the United States or not otherwise exempted from such *Page 14 burden by law. The property of the plaintiff comprised a part of the mass of property within the territory which was receiving the protection of its laws and which might lawfully be and should justly be subjected to taxation. And the right to subject such property to taxation, under the conditions and the situation in which plaintiff's property was, has not been denied by any court, but has been upheld in numerous instances. ( Utah Northern Ry. v. Fisher, 116 U.S. 28 ; Torrey v. Baldwin, 26 Pac. Rep. 908; Ph œnix Maricopa R. R. Co. v. Ter. Ariz . 26 Pac. Rep. 310; Ferris v. Vennier, 6 Dak. — 42 N.W. Rep. 34 ; Marico Ph œnix R. R. Co. v. Ariz. Ter . 156 U.S. 347 .) In Torrey v. Baldwin, 26 Pac. Rep. 908, supra, the supreme court of Wyoming held that the treaty of July 3, 1868, with the Shoshones, pursuant to which their reservation was established, contained no reservation or exception whereby it should be excluded and excepted out of the territory within which it was situated, and that the reservation was included within the territory, and that cattle thereon belonging to a white person, in no wise connected with the Indians, were subject to taxation in the county within which the reservation lay. In Phoenix and Maricopa Railroad company v. Arizona Territory, supra, the supreme court of Arizona held that in the absence of treaty or other express exclusions the different Indian reservations became a part of the territory where situate, and subject to territorial legislative jurisdiction, subject, however, to the powers of the general government to make regulations respecting the Indians, their property, etc., and that a railroad built across an Indian reservation in the territory is subject to taxation by the territory where there *Page 15 are no treaty stipulations or express exclusions against the jurisdiction of the territory; and this decision was, on appeal, affirmed by the supreme court of the United States in 156 U.S. 347 , supra . In Utah Northern Railway v. Fisher, 116 U.S. 31 , Mr. Justice Field says: ""The authority of the territory may rightfully extend to all matters not interfering with that protection. (Protection of Indians and their property). It has therefore been held that process of its courts may run into an Indian reservation of this kind where the subject matter or controversy is otherwise within their cognizance. If the plaintiff lawfully constructed and now operates a railroad through the reservation, it is not perceived that any just rights of the Indians under the treaty can be impaired by taxing the road and property used in operating it."" A further contention of the plaintiffs is: That this reservation, under the statutes of the United States, has been leased by the Osage Nation or tribe for grazing purposes and that the taxation of cattle kept and grazed upon said reservation is a direct tax upon the right of the Indians to lease the same, and decreases to the extent of the tax the value of the Indian lands; that the act authorizing such taxation is in direct derogation of the property rights of the Indians upon such reservation and is therefore void. This proposition is without merit and certainly is unsupported by authority. The authority upon which plaintiffs rely to support this contention is the case of Pollock v. the Farmers' Loan and Trust company, 157 U.S. 429 , known as the ""Income Tax"" case. Counsel in their brief quote from Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, on page 555 in the report of that case, as follows: ""The contention of the plaintiff is, first, that the law in qustion in imposing a tax upon the income of rents *Page 16 of real estate imposes a tax upon the real estate itself; and in imposing a tax upon the interest or income of bonds or other personal property held for the purpose of income, or ordinarily yielding income, imposes a tax upon the personal estate itself; that such tax is a direct tax and void because imposed without regard to the rule of apportionment, and that by reason thereof the whole law is invalid."" It is true that that contention was sustained by a majority of a divided court in that case, but I am unable to perceive its application to the principles of the case at bar. The contention was sustained in that case, because it was held that a tax upon the income or rents of real estate imposed a tax upon the real estate itself; that it was therefore a direct tax, and that being such it was obnoxious to the provision of the constitution prohibiting the levy of direct taxes except by apportionment among the several states. It would not be seriously contended that that provision of the Federal constitution prescribed a rule operative upon any other legislative authority than the congress of the United States, or in the raising of revenue for the support of any government, other than the Federal government; but even if such contention should be made, the principle of the case cited is not broad enough to cover the proposition submitted by counsel for plaintiffs. The taxation we are considering was not assessed or levied upon the real estate or other property of the Indians occupying this reservation nor upon the income or rents of such Indians derived from such real estate or other property; this tax is not levied upon the rents which are paid to these Indians under their leases to the plaintiffs, but it is levied upon the property of the plaintiffs in which the Indians have no interest. The argument that taxation upon *Page 17 property brought into this reservation for the purpose of grazing upon Indian lands is an additional servitude that decreases the salable value of the land, and that it operates in fixing the rental value of these lands to the same extent it would, if made a tax upon the land itself, is scarcely less remote than to say that the tariffs which these cattle owners have to pay to railroad corporations for transporting their cattle out of these reservations to market is an additional servitude, that decreases the rental value of the lands of the Indians; or, that the taxation of the personal property of a tenant is an added servitude on the freehold of the landlord. I do not think the act of the legislature providing for this taxation, in any manner, impairs the property rights of the Indians occupying this reservation. Another contention of the plaintiffs is that this taxation is unconstitutional and void because it rests upon the attempt of the supreme court of the territory to fix taxing districts, which is a legislative function. The answer to this proposition is that the supreme court of the territory has not attempted to fix any taxing districts; that that court, under the powers expressly vested in it by the Organic Act of the territory, in 1894, attached this reservation and unorganized country to Kay county for judicial purposes, and not for the purposes of taxation; that the taxing districts in which these taxes were imposed and levied were created and fixed, not by the supreme court, but by the legislature, in the act of 1895; the language of the act being: ""That when any cattle are kept or grazed or any other personal property is situated in any unorganized country, district or reservation of this territory, that such property shall be subject to taxation in the organized *Page 18 county to which said country, district or reservation is attached for judicial purposes."" It was by this act that a taxing district was created and not by the order of the court. Another objection which plaintiffs make against the legality of this tax is, that the act attempting to authorize it only applies to personal property; that no provision is made for the taxing of real estate in such reservation; that it is a discrimination in taxing different kinds of property, and therefore in conflict with the Organic Act. This court will take judicial knowledge of the public treaties of the United States; and from such treaties the court has judicial knowledge that the title to all the lands within this Indian reservation is in the Indian tribe, or in the United States for the use of said Indian tribe. The power of taxation possessed by the territorial government not extending to the taxing of the property of the United States, or of the Indian wards of the United States, there is no taxable real estate in said reservation, and consequently the act does not discriminate as between different kinds of property subject to taxation, there not being different kinds of property subject to taxation in such reservation. The most serious contention of the plaintiffs that confronts us in this matter is, that the act under which these taxes were assessed and levied is void for the reason that it attempts to tax property situated in these Indian reservations for the benefit of the counties to which they are attached for judicial purposes, the owners and holders of property on these Indian reservations, it being claimed, having no interest in the taxes gathered by said counties, no voice in their expenditure nor benefit *Page 19 therefrom, said Indian reservations not being within the geographical boundaries of said counties; that the taxing of the owners of said property by such counties is taking the property of the persons holding said property on said reservation for the benefit of the residents of said county and is, therefore, taking private property for private uses. It is argued that plaintiffs have no interest in the purposes for which these taxes are to be expended and will derive no benefit from their expenditure; that the moneys derived from this taxation under the county levy will all be expended within the organized county of Kay; that plaintiffs are non-residents of the territory, and that neither they or their property are within said county of Kay, and therefore cannot be benefitted by the expenditure of moneys apportioned and used for the salary fund, contingent expense fund, sinking fund, court expense fund, county supplies fund, road and bridge fund, poor fund or county school fund of said county. We have been cited to or been able to find but one authority directly in point upon the proposition as presented in this case. In the case of Ferris v. Vennier, 42 N.W. Rep. 34 , the supreme court of Dakota Territory, in a case similar to this in all particulars, save that the attached territory was not an Indian reservation but was an unorganized territory, held the levy for territorial purposes to be valid and those for county purposes to be invalid. There are a number of authorities upon analogous cases, but such authorities are conflicting. The greater number of authorities presented by counsel for plaintiffs in their brief upon this proposition relate to cases of special assessments for local improvement, such as the construction of highways, streets, pavements, *Page 20 sewers, etc., where the benefits are peculiar to a limited district or locality, and this class of cases have always been held distinct in principle from that which we are considering and the right to impose such taxes has always been held to be founded upon and to be governed by different principles from those embraced in public taxation for ordinary public or governmental purposes. Bearing upon the case at bar, is the case of Wells v. The City of Weston, 22 Mo. 384 , in which the court held that, ""The legislature cannot authorize a municipal corporation to tax for its own local purposes land lying beyond the corporate limits."" In Cheaney v. Hooser, 9 Ben Monroe, 341, the court held that the extension of the limits of one town so as to include the adjacent lands of another town against or without the consent of the owners and subject the property and people within the added territory to the jurisdiction and taxing powers of the extended municipal government without the consent of the added population, is, in effect, taking private property for public use. In Sharpless v. Mayor of Philadelphia, 21 Penn. State, 172, the court said: ""By taxation, is meant a certain mode of raising revenue for a public purpose in which the community that pays it has an interest; but to make a tax law unconstitutional on this ground, it must be apparent at the first blush that the community taxed can have no possible interest in the purpose to which their money is to be applied. And this is more especially true if it be a local tax, and if the local authorities have themselves laid the tax in pursuance of an act of the assembly."" In a case in Tennessee, Taylor, McBean Co., v. William R. Chandler et al, 9 Heiskall, 349, the court *Page 21 said: ""A state burden cannot be placed upon any territory less than the entire state, nor a county burden upon territory greater or smaller than the county."" In the case of Washington Avenue, 69 Penn. State, 361, the learned judge delivering the opinion says: ""I admit that the powers to tax is unbounded by any express limit in the constitution; that it may be exercised to the full extent of the public exigency. I concede that it differs from the power of eminent domain and has no thought of compensation by way of a return for that which is taken and applied to the public good, further than all derive benefit from the purpose to which it is applied."" In Morford v. Unger, 8 Iowa, 82 , the court said: ""The extension of the limits of a city or town so as to include its actual enlargement as manifested by houses and population, is to be deemed a legitimate exercise of legislative power. An indefinite or unreasonable extension, so as to embrace lands and farms that are distant from the local government, does not rest upon the same authority. And although it may be a delicate, as well as a difficult duty for the judiciary to interpose, we have no doubt but that there are limits beyond which the legislative discretion cannot go."" Kelley v. The City of Pittsburg, 104 U.S. 658 , was a case wherein the city of Pittsburg, under an act of the legislature, extended the city limits so as to include the plaintiff's farm, and assessed the same as other property in the city was assessed for street tax, school tax, etc. The court, in sustaining the validity of the extension, said: ""We cannot say, judicially, that Mr. Kelley received no benefit from the city organization. These streets, if they do not penetrate his farm, lead to it. The waterworks will probably reach him some day and may be near enough him now to serve on some occasions. The schools may receive his children and in this regard he *Page 22 can be in no worse condition than those living in the city having no children and who pay for the support of the schools. Every man in a county, a town, a city, a state, is deeply interested in the education of the children of the community, because his peace and quiet, his happiness and prosperity, are largely dependent upon the intelligence and moral training which it is the object of the public schools to supply to the children of his neighbors and associates, if he has none himself. The police government, the officers whose duty it is to punish and prevent crime, are paid out of the taxes. Has he no interest in their protection, because he lives farther from the court house and the police station than the others? Clearly, these are matters of detail within the legislative discretion and, therefore, of power in the lawmaking body within whose jurisdiction the parties live. This court cannot say in such cases, however great the hardships or unequal the burden, that the tax collected for such purposes, is taking the property of the taxpayers, without due process of law."" I might multiply citations from conflicting authorities like these, without finding any rule to guide or definitely determine where the line can be drawn which determines, in cases like this, the limit of legislative discretion. Nearly, if not all, these cases arose to test the extent and limit of authority in subordinate agencies of the state, like municipal corporations, and not the discretion vested in the legislature of the state. No court has yet attempted to define, specifically, the benefits that a taxpayer must receive from government, in order to make valid the public taxes taken from him. True, in theory, taxation should be equal, not only in its burdens, but in its benefits, but this equality is never attained. No one questions the right of a commonwealth to tax the property of non-residents within its borders; yet, such non-residents do not stand upon a basis of equality in the benefits *Page 23 of the government that imposes the tax. They may, or may not, receive particular benefits from its courts, its schools, the improvement of its public highways, or from any of the other purposes to which its revenues are appropriated. But such benefits are never a test of the liability of their property to taxation. The plaintiffs in this case might have their herds of cattle within the limits of Kay county and receive no greater benefit in the protection of the law than they do now; yet, they would not be heard to assert that such property should not be taxed for the various county purposes to which taxation is appropriated. The counties, cities and towns of this territory are not independent or distinct governments from that of the territory. They are a part of that government; they are the instrumentalities and agencies through which the territorial government promotes the welfare of its inhabitants and through which the territory is better enabled to protect the lives and liberties of its inhabitants and the property that is within its borders, whether that of its own citizens or that of non-residents. The nearer these purposes are attained, the greater are the benefits to these plaintiffs, as well as to all others having property subject to the protection of its laws. Laws similar to this, attaching unorganized remote territory to municipal townships in the state of Michigan, were for years maintained and enforced; and though the taxes gathered from the attached territory was appropriated and expended for the purposes of the township to which it was attached, I do not find that their validity was ever directly called into question. ( Roscommon v. Midland, 39 Mich. 424 ; Township of Comins v. Township of Harrisville, 45 Mich. 442 .) *Page 24 In this last case the facts found by the court were that from the year 1869 until March, 1877, the county of Oscoda was attached to the county of Alcona for judicial and municipal purposes, and up to the last named date, the township of Harrisville, in said Alcona county, exercised municipal jurisdiction over the territory comprising the unorganized county of Oscoda. That, in 1877, the legislature organized the county of Oscoda into a township called by the act creating it, ""The Township of Comins."" In that year, and after the passage of said act, but before said township of Comins had been fully organized by the election of township officers, the township of Harrisville made an assessment roll embracing, with other territory, all the territory in the county of Oscoda, and the taxes thus assessed were collected by the officers of the township of Harrisville. In 1879, the township of Comins made a demand on the township board of the township of Harrisville for the payment to the township of Comins for the taxes thus collected in 1877 and suit was brought therefor. On that case, Marston, chief justice, says: ""The laws of this state relating to the assessment, levy and collection of taxes, does not regard certain designated territory as a township until the proper officers necessary to conduct its affairs have been elected. The officers of the new township, not having been elected until July, there was no such perfected organization as would enable that township to assess the township and school taxes for that year. Under such circumstances, in my opinion, the township of Harrisville had a right to levy and collect the taxes in question; but whether they did or not, the present action will not lie to recover the money so collected."" I can perceive no distinction, in principle, between that case and the case at bar; and, although the legality of *Page 25 the assessment and collection of the taxes imposed was not directly involved in the case, both the circuit judge, trying the case, and the chief justice express no doubt as to their legality. Not being able to point out the provision in the constitution, the Organic Act, in any statute, or general rule limiting the powers and discretion of the legislature, in imposing these taxes, from which I can say that they are unquestionably void, I am not disposed to arbitrarily invade the province of the legislative department to sit in review without other evidence than that which they possessed, and say that in this case they have abused the discretion vested in them to such a degree as to call for our interference. Under the general rules stated herein, we have no right to do this. This taxation may not be levied upon the basis of absolute equality. It may in a measure be unjust. It may impose upon the plaintiffs in this case a burden without equal compensation in benefits with others; but this, alone, will not warrant our interference. Unquestionably the plaintiffs are benefitted in some degree by the expenditure of these taxes in Kay county. The proximity to their property of a well ordered community with courts and schools open to the plaintiffs if they wish to avail themselves of them, with good roads and bridges, with provision made for the care and maintenance of the poor and indigent, with these and the other elements of civilization, order and observance of law for which money obtained by taxation is expended, it is beyond dispute that plaintiffs have a greater security in their property rights than they would have without them. These are the benefits upon which the right of taxation is based, and gives to the legislature the *Page 26 acknowledged authority to impose taxation. The authority being acknowledged, the reasonableness of or necessity for its exercise cannot be inquired into by the courts. Of such reasonableness or necessity the legislature and not the courts are to judge. The validity of these taxes is further assailed on the ground that the act of the legislature authorizing them is obnoxious to the act of congress of July 30, 1886, 24 U.S. Stat. at Large, page 170, which provides as follows: ""That the legislature of the territories of the United States now or hereafter to be organized, shall not pass, local or special laws in any of the following enumerated cases, that is to say, for the assessment and collection of taxes, for territorial, county, township or road purposes."" It is insisted that the act in question is local and special. I cannot perceive how this contention can be sustained. The act has none of the elements of a local or special law. It does not operate upon an individual or a number of designated individuals, or upon particularly designated property. It operates upon any individual and upon any property that may come within its general provisions. Mr. Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations, page 480, says: ""The authority that legislates for the state at large, must determine whether particular rules shall extend to the whole state and all its citizens or, on the other hand, to a subdivision of the state or a single class of its citizens only."" Again he says, page 481: ""If the laws be otherwise unobjectionable, all that can be required in these cases is that they be general in their application to the class or locality to which they apply; and they are then public in character and of their propriety and policy, the legislature must judge."" *Page 27 The constitutional requirement of equal protection of the laws does not make necessary the same local regulations, municipal powers, or judicial organization or jurisdiction. ( Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U.S. 32 ; Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313 ; Ex Parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339 ). The prohibition of special legislation for the benefit of individuals does not preclude laws for the benefit of particular classes. As for example, mechanics and other laborers. ( Davis v. State, 3 Lea, 376 ). We think the case of Daily Leader v. Cameron, 3 Okla. 677 , is decisive on this point. In that case this court says: ""A statute relating to persons or things as a class, is a general law. One relating to particular persons or things of a class is special. The number of persons upon whom the law shall have any direct effect may be very few by reason of the subject to which it relates, but it must operate equally and uniformly upon all brought within the relations and circumstances for which it provides. A statute, in order to avoid a conflict with the prohibition against such special legislation, must be general in its application to the class, and all of the class within like circumstances must come within its operation."" The statute in question in this case does not operate upon persons or things within a general class, but upon persons and things as a class. It operates upon all the unorganized counties, districts and reservations within the territory, and upon property generally, within such unorganized county, district or reservation, and operates uniformly upon such several counties, districts and reservations and upon the persons and things that may be brought therein, and is therefore in no sense local or special in its character. *Page 28 It is further claimed that the act of 1895 violates the principle of uniformity in providing for an assessment of cattle kept and grazed upon these Indian reservations and unorganized territory at a different time from that provided for the assessment of personal property in the organized counties. That for this reason, it unjustly discriminates against the owner of such cattle and is therefore void. I have already shown it to be a fundamental principle that the rules of taxation shall be uniform. It is of the very nature of a tax that it should be assessed according to some uniform rules, otherwise, it would be confiscation and not taxation. But this does not mean that the time and method of assessment shall be identical, but only that after the legislature has declared what classes of property shall be subject to taxation, the tax itself shall be levied upon such, or the owner thereof, according to a uniform rate of valuation. ( Nelson Lumber Co. v. Town of Loraine, Sup. Ct. Wis. 22 Fed. Rep. 54). Statutory provisions authorizing the assessment of different classes of property, at different dates, or of the same classes of property in different localities at different dates, are so common that their validity for this reason is scarcely ever called in question. The revenue law of this territory provides that real estate shall be valued for taxation on the first day of January, and that personal property in the counties shall be assessed on the first day of February of each year. Counsel for plaintiffs, in their brief, ask: ""What valid reason can be suggested why the property situated on these Indian reservations should be assessed and valued on one day and the property situated in the organized counties should be assessed and valued on another day?"" *Page 29 I think the answer to this question is found in the language of the supreme court of Wisconsin in Nelson Lumber Company v. Town of Loraine, supra, wherein it says: ""The purpose of the law would seem to be to bring about that substantial equality in taxation which the common law, as well the constitution, requires. The legislature was aware that the logs of non-residents, as well as resident owners, were liable to be floated out of the state in the month of April, or if not run out of the state, might become mixed with the logs of other persons in the different streams in such a manner as to render it quite impracticable to take any separate account of them in the month of May when the logs of resident owners are assessed. Very often they would be beyond the jurisdiction of the taxing officer of the town, and as the owner could not be reached and had no local agent in the state, they escape taxation entirely. The law, by providing that the situation, amount and value of the logs be taken in April at the place where piled or banked, seeks to put non-resident and resident owners on the same footing."" The legislature of this territory, when they enacted the law of 1895, undoubtedly took into consideration the peculiar conditions and situation of the property to be taxed in these reservations; that nearly all of the cattle that were kept on these reservations, were brought into the territory after the first of February, and would be removed before another listing of property for taxation; and unless a different date from that existing in the general law should be fixed for its assessment, such property would entirely escape taxation. The very principle of uniformity required that this distinction in dates of assessment should be made. It was not an injustice against the owners of the property, but it was to prevent injustice to the territory and to all its tax-paying citizens, by prohibiting this property from escaping its just share *Page 30 of the burdens of taxation. I think this was a very proper exercise of the discretion of the legislature and that no discrimination exists such as is inhibited by the Organic Act of the territory and the act of congress of July 30, 1886. The final proposition contained in plaintiff's brief, that relating to the action of the territorial board of equalization, in raising the aggregate valuations of property returned from the county of Kay for the year 1895, having been fully considered and determined by this court, at this term, in the case of Wallace v. Bullen, and held adversely to the contention of the plaintiff herein, fully disposes of this point. For the reasons stated, upon the various points submitted herein, I am of the opinion that the legislature was vested with full authority to extend the revenue laws of the territory over the Indian reservations and other unorganized territory within this territory; that the act of 1895 was a proper exercise of such authority; that said act does not contravene any constitutional or other established rule of taxation; that I can find nothing in this record, showing such abuse of the discretionary power of the legislature as warrants our interference; that the assessment and taxation of plaintiffs' property under said act and in the manner shown was valid. I think that it follows, therefore, that the action of the court below in overruling defendants' demurrer to plaintiffs' petition, in so far as it related to the assessment and levy of said taxes for county purposes and perpetuating the injunction against the collection of such taxes, was erroneous; and the judgment of said court enjoining the collection of said taxes should be reversed, and this cause be dismissed. *Page 31 Scott, J., and McAtee, J., concurring to the extent of holding that the tax levied for territorial and court expense funds are valid, but also hold that the balance of the levies are unauthorized, for the reason that the people on these reservations are not interested in such levies and receive no benefit from the expenditure of the moneys derived from such levies.

"" In that year, and after the passage of said act, but before said township of Comins had been fully organized by the election of township officers, the township of Harrisville made an assessment roll embracing, with other territory, all the territory in the county of Oscoda, and the taxes thus assessed were collected by the officers of the township of Harrisville.

The plaintiffs in error are non-residents of the Territory of Oklahoma and owners of large herds of cattle that were kept and grazed, during a portion of the year 1895, in parts of the Osage Indian reservation in this territory. The defendants in error are the board of county commissioners, treasurer and sheriff of Kay county, Oklahoma Territory. *Page 4 On the third Monday in February, 1894, the supreme court of the Territory of Oklahoma, by an order entered on the journals of said court, attached to said county of Kay, for judicial purposes, all the Kaw or Kansas Indian reservation and all of the Osage Indian reservation, north of the township line dividing townships 25 and 26, north. All of said reservations, so attached to said Kay county, for judicial purposes, by such order, are without the boundaries of said Kay county, as established by the secretary of the interior, and are not within the boundaries of any organized county of this territory. Said territory, so attached to said county of Kay, for judicial purposes, is comprised wholly of lands owned and occupied by Indian tribes and consists, principally, of wild, unimproved and unallotted lands, used for grazing purposes; that plaintiffs in error, during the year 1895, and during the month of April of said year, drove, transported and shipped to the ranges and pastures in that part of said Osage Indian reservation, attached to said Kay county, for judicial purposes, as aforesaid, large herds and numbers of cattle, which were taken on to said reservation in pursuance of and by virtue and authority of certain leases to plaintiffs in error, for grazing purposes, made by the Osage tribal government under the supervision of the agent in charge of said tribe, and upon the ratification and approval of the commissioner of Indian affairs and of the secretary of the interior. And said cattle of said plaintiffs in error were, on the first day of May, kept and grazed on that part of said Indian reservation attached to said Kay county, for judicial purposes, as aforesaid. By an act approved March 5, 1895 the legislative assembly of the Territory of Oklahoma amended § 13, art. 2, ch. 7 of the Oklahoma Statutes, relating to revenue, *Page 5 so that the same reads as follows: ""That when any cattle are kept or grazed or any other personal property is situated in any unorganized country, district or reservation of this territory, such property shall be subject to taxation in the organized county to which said country, district or reservation is attached for judicial purposes,"" and authorized the board of county commissioners of the organized county or counties to which such unorganized country, district or reservation is attached, to appoint a special assessor each year, whose duty it should be to assess such property, and conferred upon such special assessor all the powers and required him to perform all the duties of a township assessor. The assessor so provided for was required to begin and perform his duties between the first day of April and the twenty-fifth day of May of each year, and to complete his duties and return his tax lists on or before June 1, and the property therein authorized to be assessed, it was provided, should be valued as of May 1, each year. In pursuance of the provisions of said act the county commissioners of said Kay county did duly appoint a special assessor for the year 1895, to assess such cattle as were kept and grazed, and any other personal property situated in the unorganized country and parts of Indian reservations attached to said Kay county for judicial purposes, and said special assessor did, by virtue of said appointment, assess all the personal property in the territory so attached to the county of Kay for judicial purposes, including all of the cattle of the said plaintiffs in error kept and grazed in said reservation on the first day of May, 1895. The said special assessor assessed the property of these plaintiffs in error so located on said territory attached to said county of Kay for judicial purposes *Page 6 as aforesaid, and returned the same upon an assessment roll at the total valuation of $760,469; that thereafter the said sum was, by the clerk of said county, carried into the aggregate assessment for said county, and by him certified to the auditor of the territory; that the territorial board of equalization, in acting upon the various assessments of the various counties, as certified to said board, raised the aggregate valuation of the property returned for taxation upon the tax rolls of said county of Kay, 35 per cent, and the county clerk for said county carried out the raised valuation so certified to him by said territorial board of equalization against the property of these plaintiffs in error, and made the aggregate valuation of such property $1,026,634. Thereafter the territorial board of equalization levied and duly certified to the county clerk of the county of Kay tax levies, for territorial purposes for the year 1895, as follows: General revenue, three mills on the dollar. University fund, one-half mill on the dollar. Normal school fund, one-half mill on the dollar. Bond interest fund, one-half mill on the dollar. Board of education fund, one-half mill on the dollar. That the board of county commissioners for the county of Kay made the following levies for the year 1895: For salaries, five mills on the dollar. For contingent expenses, three mills on the dollar. For sinking fund, one and one-half mills on the dollar. For court expenses, two and one-half mills on the dollar. For county supplies, three mills on the dollar. For road and bridge fund, two mills on the dollar. For poor fund of said county, one mill on the dollar. For county school fund of said county, one mill on the dollar. *Page 7 The county clerk of said county of Kay carried the valuation of the property of these plaintiffs in error upon the tax rolls of said county and against the same extended the levies as aforesaid and charged against the property of these plaintiffs in error in the aggregate the sum of $26,174.16. Before these taxes became delinquent, plaintiffs in error began to remove or attempted to remove their respective property from the territory attached to Kay county for judicial purposes, and beyond the limits of Oklahoma Territory. The treasurer of said Kay county issued tax warrants for the several amounts of taxes levied against the property of each of said plaintiffs in error and delivered the same to the sheriff of said county for execution. Said sheriff seized certain property of each of plaintiffs in error by virtue of such tax warrants. The plaintiffs in error filed their several petitions in the district court of Kay county and on application obtained injunctions, restraining the defendants in error from making any further attempt to collect such taxes. Afterwards, on motion, the several actions were consolidated into one. To the petition, filed in such consolidated action, the defendants in error filed a general demurrer. At the hearing the district court sustained the demurrer in part and overruled it in part, holding that all of the levies made for territorial purposes and the county levy for court expenses, were valid; and as to those levies, the injunction was dissolved, and as to all of the other county levies, such injunctions were made perpetual. From that part of the order and judgment of the court dissolving the injunction as to the territorial taxes and the one county fund levy, plaintiffs appealed. From that part perpetuating the injunction as to all of the county levies, *Page 8 except that for court expenses, the defendants appealed, and filed their cross-petition in error, and the case is thus here for review. The opinion of the court was delivered by The questions involved are of great public and private interest and have received from us that very careful consideration and attention which their importance demands. By § 6 of the Organic Act of the territory, it is provided: ""That the legislative power of the territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation, not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the United States, but no law shall be passed interfering with the primary disposal of the soil; no tax shall be imposed on the property of the United States nor shall the lands or other property of non-residents be taxed higher than the lands or other property of residents, nor shall any law be passed impairing the right to private property, nor shall any unequal discrimination be made in taxing different kinds of property, but all property subject to taxation shall be taxed in proportion to its value."" * * A broader grant of legislative power than that contained in this section could hardly be conceived of. This Organic Act of the territory defined its boundaries, created a government which comprised a legislative department, vested with power of legislating upon all rightful subjects of legislation and co-extensive with the exterior boundaries of the territory. The taxing power *Page 9 is a part of the legislative power of government and taxation is a rightful subject of legislation. Taxes are the enforced contributions upon persons or property levied by the government by virtue of its sovereignty for the support of government and for public needs. The citizen pays from his property the portion demanded in order that by means thereof he may be secured in the enjoyment of the benefits of organized society. The power is unlimited in its reach as to subjects; in its very nature, it acknowledges no limit; it is sometimes said that in its exercise it may become a power to confiscate or destroy, but this must be thus qualified, that under our system of constitutional governments it differs from the forced contributions, loans and benevolences of arbitrary and tyrannical governments. It is not an arbitrary power, nor can it be exercised capriciously. It is hedged about and restricted by wise constitutional limitations and fixed general rules. These constitutional limitations and general rules are designed to secure a just apportionment of the burdens of government by requiring uniformity of contributions, levied by fixed general rule, and apportioned by the law according to some uniform measure of equality. Within these rules and limitations the authority and power of the legislative department is absolute and conclusive. The ends sought to be reached by these general and fundamental rules and constitutional restrictions upon upon the powers of taxation are equality, uniformity and justice in apportioning the burdens of government; but as the idea of exact equality, uniformity and justice under any system of human laws being attainable is Utopian, it is not expected that such exactness can be attained in the *Page 10 exercise of the powers of taxation. Notwithstanding such fixed general rules and limitations, the discretion of the legislature is very broad and its exercise may work injustice and oppression. If such discretionary power be threatened with abuse, security must be found in the responsibility of the legislature that imposes the tax to the constituency that elected them. The judicial cannot prescribe to the legislative department of the government limitations upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers. The power to tax may be exercised oppressively upon persons or with regard to property, but if it do not clearly violate some established rule of limitation, the responsibility of the legislature is not to the courts but to the people by whom its members are elected. The courts can only interfere when the conclusion is unavoidable, that the legislature has transcended its powers or clearly violated some constitutional or other fixed general ruling defining or limiting such power. ( Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 548 ; Weston v. Charleston, 2 Peters, 449 -466; Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 ; Tallman v. Butler, 12 Iowa, 531 .) Our inquiry then is, did the legislature, by the act of 1895, under authority of which the taxes in controversy were assessed and levied, transcend its powers, and is such act a violation of any constitutional or other fixed general rule controlling the discretion of the legislature? The only limitation or restriction upon the taxing power of the legislature, which I find in the Organic Act for the territory is that contained in § 6 of said act, which is as follows: ""No tax shall be imposed on the property of the United States, nor shall the lands or other property of non-residents be taxed higher than the lands or other property of residents, nor shall any law be passed impairing *Page 11 the right to private property, nor shall any unequal discrimination be made in taxing different kinds of property, but all property subject to taxation shall be taxed in proportion to its value."" And the following provision in § 1 of said act. ""Provided, that nothing in this act shall be construed to impair any right now pertaining to any Indians or Indian tribe in said territory under the laws, agreements and treaties of the United States, or to impair the rights of person or property pertaining to said Indians, or to affect the authority of the government of the United States to make any regulation or to make any law respecting said Indians, their lands, property or other rights which it would have been competent to make or enact if this act had not been passed."" If, therefore, there be any restriction or limitation upon the power of the legislature to tax the property of plaintiffs or which makes such taxation invalid, it must be found in these provisions of the Organic Act or in the constitution, treaties or legislation of the United States, or some general rule inherent in our system of government. It is not contended that the act under which these taxes are sought to be imposed is obnoxious to any provision of the Federal constitution, but it is contended by plaintiffs that the legislature has no jurisdiction to enact laws, especially tax laws, and put the same in force in these Indian reservations. The argument being that although these reservations are within the exterior boundaries of Oklahoma Territory, yet they comprise no part of the territory for territorial governmental purposes, but are exclusively under the jurisdiction of the United States, and that the legislative power of the territory does not extend over them. It is conceded by counsel for plaintiffs that the treaty under which the Osage Indians were settled on these lands contained no *Page 12 provision or stipulation by which said Indian tribe or the lands occupied by them were not, without their consent, to be included within the limits or jurisdiction of any state or territory that might thereafter be created and which should include such reservation within its exterior boundaries. That there was at the time the Organic Act, creating the Territory of Oklahoma, was passed, and at the time the act of 1895, authorizing the taxation in controversy was enacted, and at the time these taxes were assessed and levied, no treaty with the Osage Indian tribe that the lands or any part thereof, within this reservation, should be thus excluded from the limits and jurisdiction of any state or territory. I think there is no proposition better settled by authorities than that, in the absence of such treaty stipulation, the authority of the territory may rightfully extend over such reservation in all matters of rightful legislation, not interfering with the persons and property of the Indians within such reservation, under the protection of the laws and authority of the United States; and that as to all matters and subjects of rightful legislation, not interfering with that protection, and not otherwise repugnant to the constitution and laws of the United States, the legislative power of the territory is absolute. ( Utah Northern Railway v. Fisher, 116 U.S. 28 ; Langford v. Monteith, 102 U.S. 145 ; Ph œnix and Maricopa R. R. Co., v. Arizona Territory, Sup. Court of Ariz. 26 Pac. Rep. 310, Maricopa Ph œnix R. R. Co., v. Ariz. Ter . 156 U.S. 347 ; Torrey v. Baldwin, 26 Pac. Rep. 908; Gon-Shay-ee petitioner 130 U.S. 343 ; Ex parte Crow Dog 109 U.S. 556 -560; United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 ; United States v. Pridgeon, 153 U.S. 48 .) This doctrine was distinctly held by this court in Keokuk v. Ulam, 4 Okla. Rep. 5 , 38 Pac. Rep. 1083. *Page 13 The contention of plaintiffs upon this proposition would seem to be based upon reasonings and authorities which are not applicable. Their contention seems to be that these reservations are to be considered as exclusively under the jurisdiction of the United States, the same as lands purchased by the United States within the boundaries of states, and with the consent of said states for the purposes of forts, arsenals, magazines, navy yards, dock yards, etc. If this contention were correct, then it would be supported by all the authorities and would prevail, for I concede it to be uncontroverted that property situated wholly within boundaries exclusively within the jurisdiction of the United States, cannot be taxed by the state or territory within which it may be situated; but these reservations are not within boundaries exclusively within the jurisdiction of the United States, for the reason that congress in § 6 of the Organic Act of this territory delegated to the government of the territory legislative power extending to all rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the United States within the exterior boundaries of the territory created by that act, which includes the reservation which is the locus of this controversy; that the jurisdiction conferred upon the territory is not exclusive; that congress has reserved to itself jurisdiction over the persons and lands of the Indians occupying the reservation, does not diminish or restrict the authority of the territory to legislate concerning the persons and property of citizens of the United States therein. It was the duty of the territorial legislature to apportion the burdens of government upon all property within the territory not withdrawn from its jurisdiction by the Organic Act or other laws of the United States or not otherwise exempted from such *Page 14 burden by law. The property of the plaintiff comprised a part of the mass of property within the territory which was receiving the protection of its laws and which might lawfully be and should justly be subjected to taxation. And the right to subject such property to taxation, under the conditions and the situation in which plaintiff's property was, has not been denied by any court, but has been upheld in numerous instances. ( Utah Northern Ry. v. Fisher, 116 U.S. 28 ; Torrey v. Baldwin, 26 Pac. Rep. 908; Ph œnix Maricopa R. R. Co. v. Ter. Ariz . 26 Pac. Rep. 310; Ferris v. Vennier, 6 Dak. — 42 N.W. Rep. 34 ; Marico Ph œnix R. R. Co. v. Ariz. Ter . 156 U.S. 347 .) In Torrey v. Baldwin, 26 Pac. Rep. 908, supra, the supreme court of Wyoming held that the treaty of July 3, 1868, with the Shoshones, pursuant to which their reservation was established, contained no reservation or exception whereby it should be excluded and excepted out of the territory within which it was situated, and that the reservation was included within the territory, and that cattle thereon belonging to a white person, in no wise connected with the Indians, were subject to taxation in the county within which the reservation lay. In Phoenix and Maricopa Railroad company v. Arizona Territory, supra, the supreme court of Arizona held that in the absence of treaty or other express exclusions the different Indian reservations became a part of the territory where situate, and subject to territorial legislative jurisdiction, subject, however, to the powers of the general government to make regulations respecting the Indians, their property, etc., and that a railroad built across an Indian reservation in the territory is subject to taxation by the territory where there *Page 15 are no treaty stipulations or express exclusions against the jurisdiction of the territory; and this decision was, on appeal, affirmed by the supreme court of the United States in 156 U.S. 347 , supra . In Utah Northern Railway v. Fisher, 116 U.S. 31 , Mr. Justice Field says: ""The authority of the territory may rightfully extend to all matters not interfering with that protection. (Protection of Indians and their property). It has therefore been held that process of its courts may run into an Indian reservation of this kind where the subject matter or controversy is otherwise within their cognizance. If the plaintiff lawfully constructed and now operates a railroad through the reservation, it is not perceived that any just rights of the Indians under the treaty can be impaired by taxing the road and property used in operating it."" A further contention of the plaintiffs is: That this reservation, under the statutes of the United States, has been leased by the Osage Nation or tribe for grazing purposes and that the taxation of cattle kept and grazed upon said reservation is a direct tax upon the right of the Indians to lease the same, and decreases to the extent of the tax the value of the Indian lands; that the act authorizing such taxation is in direct derogation of the property rights of the Indians upon such reservation and is therefore void. This proposition is without merit and certainly is unsupported by authority. The authority upon which plaintiffs rely to support this contention is the case of Pollock v. the Farmers' Loan and Trust company, 157 U.S. 429 , known as the ""Income Tax"" case. Counsel in their brief quote from Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, on page 555 in the report of that case, as follows: ""The contention of the plaintiff is, first, that the law in qustion in imposing a tax upon the income of rents *Page 16 of real estate imposes a tax upon the real estate itself; and in imposing a tax upon the interest or income of bonds or other personal property held for the purpose of income, or ordinarily yielding income, imposes a tax upon the personal estate itself; that such tax is a direct tax and void because imposed without regard to the rule of apportionment, and that by reason thereof the whole law is invalid."" It is true that that contention was sustained by a majority of a divided court in that case, but I am unable to perceive its application to the principles of the case at bar. The contention was sustained in that case, because it was held that a tax upon the income or rents of real estate imposed a tax upon the real estate itself; that it was therefore a direct tax, and that being such it was obnoxious to the provision of the constitution prohibiting the levy of direct taxes except by apportionment among the several states. It would not be seriously contended that that provision of the Federal constitution prescribed a rule operative upon any other legislative authority than the congress of the United States, or in the raising of revenue for the support of any government, other than the Federal government; but even if such contention should be made, the principle of the case cited is not broad enough to cover the proposition submitted by counsel for plaintiffs. The taxation we are considering was not assessed or levied upon the real estate or other property of the Indians occupying this reservation nor upon the income or rents of such Indians derived from such real estate or other property; this tax is not levied upon the rents which are paid to these Indians under their leases to the plaintiffs, but it is levied upon the property of the plaintiffs in which the Indians have no interest. The argument that taxation upon *Page 17 property brought into this reservation for the purpose of grazing upon Indian lands is an additional servitude that decreases the salable value of the land, and that it operates in fixing the rental value of these lands to the same extent it would, if made a tax upon the land itself, is scarcely less remote than to say that the tariffs which these cattle owners have to pay to railroad corporations for transporting their cattle out of these reservations to market is an additional servitude, that decreases the rental value of the lands of the Indians; or, that the taxation of the personal property of a tenant is an added servitude on the freehold of the landlord. I do not think the act of the legislature providing for this taxation, in any manner, impairs the property rights of the Indians occupying this reservation. Another contention of the plaintiffs is that this taxation is unconstitutional and void because it rests upon the attempt of the supreme court of the territory to fix taxing districts, which is a legislative function. The answer to this proposition is that the supreme court of the territory has not attempted to fix any taxing districts; that that court, under the powers expressly vested in it by the Organic Act of the territory, in 1894, attached this reservation and unorganized country to Kay county for judicial purposes, and not for the purposes of taxation; that the taxing districts in which these taxes were imposed and levied were created and fixed, not by the supreme court, but by the legislature, in the act of 1895; the language of the act being: ""That when any cattle are kept or grazed or any other personal property is situated in any unorganized country, district or reservation of this territory, that such property shall be subject to taxation in the organized *Page 18 county to which said country, district or reservation is attached for judicial purposes."" It was by this act that a taxing district was created and not by the order of the court. Another objection which plaintiffs make against the legality of this tax is, that the act attempting to authorize it only applies to personal property; that no provision is made for the taxing of real estate in such reservation; that it is a discrimination in taxing different kinds of property, and therefore in conflict with the Organic Act. This court will take judicial knowledge of the public treaties of the United States; and from such treaties the court has judicial knowledge that the title to all the lands within this Indian reservation is in the Indian tribe, or in the United States for the use of said Indian tribe. The power of taxation possessed by the territorial government not extending to the taxing of the property of the United States, or of the Indian wards of the United States, there is no taxable real estate in said reservation, and consequently the act does not discriminate as between different kinds of property subject to taxation, there not being different kinds of property subject to taxation in such reservation. The most serious contention of the plaintiffs that confronts us in this matter is, that the act under which these taxes were assessed and levied is void for the reason that it attempts to tax property situated in these Indian reservations for the benefit of the counties to which they are attached for judicial purposes, the owners and holders of property on these Indian reservations, it being claimed, having no interest in the taxes gathered by said counties, no voice in their expenditure nor benefit *Page 19 therefrom, said Indian reservations not being within the geographical boundaries of said counties; that the taxing of the owners of said property by such counties is taking the property of the persons holding said property on said reservation for the benefit of the residents of said county and is, therefore, taking private property for private uses. It is argued that plaintiffs have no interest in the purposes for which these taxes are to be expended and will derive no benefit from their expenditure; that the moneys derived from this taxation under the county levy will all be expended within the organized county of Kay; that plaintiffs are non-residents of the territory, and that neither they or their property are within said county of Kay, and therefore cannot be benefitted by the expenditure of moneys apportioned and used for the salary fund, contingent expense fund, sinking fund, court expense fund, county supplies fund, road and bridge fund, poor fund or county school fund of said county. We have been cited to or been able to find but one authority directly in point upon the proposition as presented in this case. In the case of Ferris v. Vennier, 42 N.W. Rep. 34 , the supreme court of Dakota Territory, in a case similar to this in all particulars, save that the attached territory was not an Indian reservation but was an unorganized territory, held the levy for territorial purposes to be valid and those for county purposes to be invalid. There are a number of authorities upon analogous cases, but such authorities are conflicting. The greater number of authorities presented by counsel for plaintiffs in their brief upon this proposition relate to cases of special assessments for local improvement, such as the construction of highways, streets, pavements, *Page 20 sewers, etc., where the benefits are peculiar to a limited district or locality, and this class of cases have always been held distinct in principle from that which we are considering and the right to impose such taxes has always been held to be founded upon and to be governed by different principles from those embraced in public taxation for ordinary public or governmental purposes. Bearing upon the case at bar, is the case of Wells v. The City of Weston, 22 Mo. 384 , in which the court held that, ""The legislature cannot authorize a municipal corporation to tax for its own local purposes land lying beyond the corporate limits."" In Cheaney v. Hooser, 9 Ben Monroe, 341, the court held that the extension of the limits of one town so as to include the adjacent lands of another town against or without the consent of the owners and subject the property and people within the added territory to the jurisdiction and taxing powers of the extended municipal government without the consent of the added population, is, in effect, taking private property for public use. In Sharpless v. Mayor of Philadelphia, 21 Penn. State, 172, the court said: ""By taxation, is meant a certain mode of raising revenue for a public purpose in which the community that pays it has an interest; but to make a tax law unconstitutional on this ground, it must be apparent at the first blush that the community taxed can have no possible interest in the purpose to which their money is to be applied. And this is more especially true if it be a local tax, and if the local authorities have themselves laid the tax in pursuance of an act of the assembly."" In a case in Tennessee, Taylor, McBean Co., v. William R. Chandler et al, 9 Heiskall, 349, the court *Page 21 said: ""A state burden cannot be placed upon any territory less than the entire state, nor a county burden upon territory greater or smaller than the county."" In the case of Washington Avenue, 69 Penn. State, 361, the learned judge delivering the opinion says: ""I admit that the powers to tax is unbounded by any express limit in the constitution; that it may be exercised to the full extent of the public exigency. I concede that it differs from the power of eminent domain and has no thought of compensation by way of a return for that which is taken and applied to the public good, further than all derive benefit from the purpose to which it is applied."" In Morford v. Unger, 8 Iowa, 82 , the court said: ""The extension of the limits of a city or town so as to include its actual enlargement as manifested by houses and population, is to be deemed a legitimate exercise of legislative power. An indefinite or unreasonable extension, so as to embrace lands and farms that are distant from the local government, does not rest upon the same authority. And although it may be a delicate, as well as a difficult duty for the judiciary to interpose, we have no doubt but that there are limits beyond which the legislative discretion cannot go."" Kelley v. The City of Pittsburg, 104 U.S. 658 , was a case wherein the city of Pittsburg, under an act of the legislature, extended the city limits so as to include the plaintiff's farm, and assessed the same as other property in the city was assessed for street tax, school tax, etc. The court, in sustaining the validity of the extension, said: ""We cannot say, judicially, that Mr. Kelley received no benefit from the city organization. These streets, if they do not penetrate his farm, lead to it. The waterworks will probably reach him some day and may be near enough him now to serve on some occasions. The schools may receive his children and in this regard he *Page 22 can be in no worse condition than those living in the city having no children and who pay for the support of the schools. Every man in a county, a town, a city, a state, is deeply interested in the education of the children of the community, because his peace and quiet, his happiness and prosperity, are largely dependent upon the intelligence and moral training which it is the object of the public schools to supply to the children of his neighbors and associates, if he has none himself. The police government, the officers whose duty it is to punish and prevent crime, are paid out of the taxes. Has he no interest in their protection, because he lives farther from the court house and the police station than the others? Clearly, these are matters of detail within the legislative discretion and, therefore, of power in the lawmaking body within whose jurisdiction the parties live. This court cannot say in such cases, however great the hardships or unequal the burden, that the tax collected for such purposes, is taking the property of the taxpayers, without due process of law."" I might multiply citations from conflicting authorities like these, without finding any rule to guide or definitely determine where the line can be drawn which determines, in cases like this, the limit of legislative discretion. Nearly, if not all, these cases arose to test the extent and limit of authority in subordinate agencies of the state, like municipal corporations, and not the discretion vested in the legislature of the state. No court has yet attempted to define, specifically, the benefits that a taxpayer must receive from government, in order to make valid the public taxes taken from him. True, in theory, taxation should be equal, not only in its burdens, but in its benefits, but this equality is never attained. No one questions the right of a commonwealth to tax the property of non-residents within its borders; yet, such non-residents do not stand upon a basis of equality in the benefits *Page 23 of the government that imposes the tax. They may, or may not, receive particular benefits from its courts, its schools, the improvement of its public highways, or from any of the other purposes to which its revenues are appropriated. But such benefits are never a test of the liability of their property to taxation. The plaintiffs in this case might have their herds of cattle within the limits of Kay county and receive no greater benefit in the protection of the law than they do now; yet, they would not be heard to assert that such property should not be taxed for the various county purposes to which taxation is appropriated. The counties, cities and towns of this territory are not independent or distinct governments from that of the territory. They are a part of that government; they are the instrumentalities and agencies through which the territorial government promotes the welfare of its inhabitants and through which the territory is better enabled to protect the lives and liberties of its inhabitants and the property that is within its borders, whether that of its own citizens or that of non-residents. The nearer these purposes are attained, the greater are the benefits to these plaintiffs, as well as to all others having property subject to the protection of its laws. Laws similar to this, attaching unorganized remote territory to municipal townships in the state of Michigan, were for years maintained and enforced; and though the taxes gathered from the attached territory was appropriated and expended for the purposes of the township to which it was attached, I do not find that their validity was ever directly called into question. ( Roscommon v. Midland, 39 Mich. 424 ; Township of Comins v. Township of Harrisville, 45 Mich. 442 .) *Page 24 In this last case the facts found by the court were that from the year 1869 until March, 1877, the county of Oscoda was attached to the county of Alcona for judicial and municipal purposes, and up to the last named date, the township of Harrisville, in said Alcona county, exercised municipal jurisdiction over the territory comprising the unorganized county of Oscoda. That, in 1877, the legislature organized the county of Oscoda into a township called by the act creating it, ""The Township of Comins."" In that year, and after the passage of said act, but before said township of Comins had been fully organized by the election of township officers, the township of Harrisville made an assessment roll embracing, with other territory, all the territory in the county of Oscoda, and the taxes thus assessed were collected by the officers of the township of Harrisville. In 1879, the township of Comins made a demand on the township board of the township of Harrisville for the payment to the township of Comins for the taxes thus collected in 1877 and suit was brought therefor. On that case, Marston, chief justice, says: ""The laws of this state relating to the assessment, levy and collection of taxes, does not regard certain designated territory as a township until the proper officers necessary to conduct its affairs have been elected. The officers of the new township, not having been elected until July, there was no such perfected organization as would enable that township to assess the township and school taxes for that year. Under such circumstances, in my opinion, the township of Harrisville had a right to levy and collect the taxes in question; but whether they did or not, the present action will not lie to recover the money so collected."" I can perceive no distinction, in principle, between that case and the case at bar; and, although the legality of *Page 25 the assessment and collection of the taxes imposed was not directly involved in the case, both the circuit judge, trying the case, and the chief justice express no doubt as to their legality. Not being able to point out the provision in the constitution, the Organic Act, in any statute, or general rule limiting the powers and discretion of the legislature, in imposing these taxes, from which I can say that they are unquestionably void, I am not disposed to arbitrarily invade the province of the legislative department to sit in review without other evidence than that which they possessed, and say that in this case they have abused the discretion vested in them to such a degree as to call for our interference. Under the general rules stated herein, we have no right to do this. This taxation may not be levied upon the basis of absolute equality. It may in a measure be unjust. It may impose upon the plaintiffs in this case a burden without equal compensation in benefits with others; but this, alone, will not warrant our interference. Unquestionably the plaintiffs are benefitted in some degree by the expenditure of these taxes in Kay county. The proximity to their property of a well ordered community with courts and schools open to the plaintiffs if they wish to avail themselves of them, with good roads and bridges, with provision made for the care and maintenance of the poor and indigent, with these and the other elements of civilization, order and observance of law for which money obtained by taxation is expended, it is beyond dispute that plaintiffs have a greater security in their property rights than they would have without them. These are the benefits upon which the right of taxation is based, and gives to the legislature the *Page 26 acknowledged authority to impose taxation. The authority being acknowledged, the reasonableness of or necessity for its exercise cannot be inquired into by the courts. Of such reasonableness or necessity the legislature and not the courts are to judge. The validity of these taxes is further assailed on the ground that the act of the legislature authorizing them is obnoxious to the act of congress of July 30, 1886, 24 U.S. Stat. at Large, page 170, which provides as follows: ""That the legislature of the territories of the United States now or hereafter to be organized, shall not pass, local or special laws in any of the following enumerated cases, that is to say, for the assessment and collection of taxes, for territorial, county, township or road purposes."" It is insisted that the act in question is local and special. I cannot perceive how this contention can be sustained. The act has none of the elements of a local or special law. It does not operate upon an individual or a number of designated individuals, or upon particularly designated property. It operates upon any individual and upon any property that may come within its general provisions. Mr. Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations, page 480, says: ""The authority that legislates for the state at large, must determine whether particular rules shall extend to the whole state and all its citizens or, on the other hand, to a subdivision of the state or a single class of its citizens only."" Again he says, page 481: ""If the laws be otherwise unobjectionable, all that can be required in these cases is that they be general in their application to the class or locality to which they apply; and they are then public in character and of their propriety and policy, the legislature must judge."" *Page 27 The constitutional requirement of equal protection of the laws does not make necessary the same local regulations, municipal powers, or judicial organization or jurisdiction. ( Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U.S. 32 ; Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313 ; Ex Parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339 ). The prohibition of special legislation for the benefit of individuals does not preclude laws for the benefit of particular classes. As for example, mechanics and other laborers. ( Davis v. State, 3 Lea, 376 ). We think the case of Daily Leader v. Cameron, 3 Okla. 677 , is decisive on this point. In that case this court says: ""A statute relating to persons or things as a class, is a general law. One relating to particular persons or things of a class is special. The number of persons upon whom the law shall have any direct effect may be very few by reason of the subject to which it relates, but it must operate equally and uniformly upon all brought within the relations and circumstances for which it provides. A statute, in order to avoid a conflict with the prohibition against such special legislation, must be general in its application to the class, and all of the class within like circumstances must come within its operation."" The statute in question in this case does not operate upon persons or things within a general class, but upon persons and things as a class. It operates upon all the unorganized counties, districts and reservations within the territory, and upon property generally, within such unorganized county, district or reservation, and operates uniformly upon such several counties, districts and reservations and upon the persons and things that may be brought therein, and is therefore in no sense local or special in its character. *Page 28 It is further claimed that the act of 1895 violates the principle of uniformity in providing for an assessment of cattle kept and grazed upon these Indian reservations and unorganized territory at a different time from that provided for the assessment of personal property in the organized counties. That for this reason, it unjustly discriminates against the owner of such cattle and is therefore void. I have already shown it to be a fundamental principle that the rules of taxation shall be uniform. It is of the very nature of a tax that it should be assessed according to some uniform rules, otherwise, it would be confiscation and not taxation. But this does not mean that the time and method of assessment shall be identical, but only that after the legislature has declared what classes of property shall be subject to taxation, the tax itself shall be levied upon such, or the owner thereof, according to a uniform rate of valuation. ( Nelson Lumber Co. v. Town of Loraine, Sup. Ct. Wis. 22 Fed. Rep. 54). Statutory provisions authorizing the assessment of different classes of property, at different dates, or of the same classes of property in different localities at different dates, are so common that their validity for this reason is scarcely ever called in question. The revenue law of this territory provides that real estate shall be valued for taxation on the first day of January, and that personal property in the counties shall be assessed on the first day of February of each year. Counsel for plaintiffs, in their brief, ask: ""What valid reason can be suggested why the property situated on these Indian reservations should be assessed and valued on one day and the property situated in the organized counties should be assessed and valued on another day?"" *Page 29 I think the answer to this question is found in the language of the supreme court of Wisconsin in Nelson Lumber Company v. Town of Loraine, supra, wherein it says: ""The purpose of the law would seem to be to bring about that substantial equality in taxation which the common law, as well the constitution, requires. The legislature was aware that the logs of non-residents, as well as resident owners, were liable to be floated out of the state in the month of April, or if not run out of the state, might become mixed with the logs of other persons in the different streams in such a manner as to render it quite impracticable to take any separate account of them in the month of May when the logs of resident owners are assessed. Very often they would be beyond the jurisdiction of the taxing officer of the town, and as the owner could not be reached and had no local agent in the state, they escape taxation entirely. The law, by providing that the situation, amount and value of the logs be taken in April at the place where piled or banked, seeks to put non-resident and resident owners on the same footing."" The legislature of this territory, when they enacted the law of 1895, undoubtedly took into consideration the peculiar conditions and situation of the property to be taxed in these reservations; that nearly all of the cattle that were kept on these reservations, were brought into the territory after the first of February, and would be removed before another listing of property for taxation; and unless a different date from that existing in the general law should be fixed for its assessment, such property would entirely escape taxation. The very principle of uniformity required that this distinction in dates of assessment should be made. It was not an injustice against the owners of the property, but it was to prevent injustice to the territory and to all its tax-paying citizens, by prohibiting this property from escaping its just share *Page 30 of the burdens of taxation. I think this was a very proper exercise of the discretion of the legislature and that no discrimination exists such as is inhibited by the Organic Act of the territory and the act of congress of July 30, 1886. The final proposition contained in plaintiff's brief, that relating to the action of the territorial board of equalization, in raising the aggregate valuations of property returned from the county of Kay for the year 1895, having been fully considered and determined by this court, at this term, in the case of Wallace v. Bullen, and held adversely to the contention of the plaintiff herein, fully disposes of this point. For the reasons stated, upon the various points submitted herein, I am of the opinion that the legislature was vested with full authority to extend the revenue laws of the territory over the Indian reservations and other unorganized territory within this territory; that the act of 1895 was a proper exercise of such authority; that said act does not contravene any constitutional or other established rule of taxation; that I can find nothing in this record, showing such abuse of the discretionary power of the legislature as warrants our interference; that the assessment and taxation of plaintiffs' property under said act and in the manner shown was valid. I think that it follows, therefore, that the action of the court below in overruling defendants' demurrer to plaintiffs' petition, in so far as it related to the assessment and levy of said taxes for county purposes and perpetuating the injunction against the collection of such taxes, was erroneous; and the judgment of said court enjoining the collection of said taxes should be reversed, and this cause be dismissed. *Page 31 Scott, J., and McAtee, J., concurring to the extent of holding that the tax levied for territorial and court expense funds are valid, but also hold that the balance of the levies are unauthorized, for the reason that the people on these reservations are not interested in such levies and receive no benefit from the expenditure of the moneys derived from such levies.

It is conceded in - this case that tbe court properly instructed the jury upon the measure of damages, but it is claimed that the court erroneously instructed them on the questions of negligence involved. Upon all these questions the jury found for the plaintiff, and I deem it unnecessary to discuss them. * 512It is insisted that the jury - were probably prejudiced upon the measure of damages by improper instructions upon the law of negligence. I cannot accede to this proposition. The law casts no such reflection upon honest and intelligent jurors. The law does not presume that a jury, which found the defendant liable notwithstanding erroneous instructions by the court, has been prejudiced thereby in their assessment of damages, especially in a case like the "" present one. The verdict was for $ 150. What should have been the amount of damages so that the Court would say that they were not probably prejudiced? The result of this rule would be that a court must correctly instruct the jury upon all branches of every case, in order to avoid prejudicing the jury in their assessment of damages. But, in determining the question as applied to the present case, it is proper to consider the allegations in the declaration as to the injury and the consequent damages, and the proofs. The only allegation of special damages is — “ That plaintiff had been put to great expense in procuring medicine, medical attendance, and care, in which he had expended the sum of $ 500 for physicians5 services, nurses, and help. 55 It contains the general allegation that he was — “ G - reatly and permanently injured, suffered great physical and mental pain, and became sore, sick, lame, and languishing. 55 No claim, is made of injury to his horses or wagon. He called no physician, and expended no money for nursing, medicine, or help. There is no evidence that Dr. Champlin attended plaintiff, at any time, in consequence of sickness claimed to have been the result of this accident. There was no evidence that plaintiff was unable to attend to his work for more than two weeks, * 513and this testimony does not come from the plaintiff himself, but from his. son, who thought he was in bed four or five days, and that it was some two weeks before he got out. The declaration was not sufficiently specific to admit testimony of any permanent injury. No physician was called for the plaintiff, and the testimony of any permanent injury was of too ' indefinite a character ' to form any reasonable basis for an award of damages. Plaintiff ’ s testimony on this point is as follows : “ I am hardly a day without headache ever since. My off side is kind of not exactly right. I cannot remember as well as I use to before I got hurt. ” The evidence in regard to the headache. s was stricken out by the court. Certainly no one would contend that the statement, “ my off side is kind of not exactly right, ” would furnish any basis for the jury to award damages. How was it not right? and why was it not right? were questions the jury must answer ; and there was nothing to connect this trouble, whatever it was, with the injury. How much should the jury have awarded because he could not remember as well as he did before? It would be absurd to base damages upon such evidence. The testimony of his son John is no more satisfactory. It is as follows : “ Since the injury I have noticed that father was sickly like a great many times, and seemed to be almost out of his head, and would refuse to eat his meals, and the like of that ; and, furthermore, he has had one or two sick spells since that, and he always gets them when he does something that he stoops over. ” The other son testified : “ Since that time his mind does not seem to be as it was before, and his health has not been as it was before. ” This loose and indefinite testimony constitutes all the * 514evidence of any peiunanent injury there is in the case. The jury evidently ignored it as of no value, as, indeed, they should have done. I think the court would have been justified in instructing the jury that there was no evidence of any permanent injury for them to consider. If there was no permanent injury, the damages assessed were ample under the proofs. There was evidence from the plaintiff ’ s own witnesses that plaintiff had a runaway team at the time, and that this same team had run away with him and with others before. If he took such a team into this place, it was a proper question for the jury to determine whether he was guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident. Under this record, I see no reason for holding that the jury were prejudiced by the alleged erroneous instructions. The errors, if any, were certainly not glaring ones. Judgment should be affirmed.

6212018_1,2232,"OPINION OF THE COURT Memorandum. Appeal from decision unanimously dismissed. * 342Final judgment unanimously affirmed without costs. The tenant in this nonpayment proceeding resides in a building that receives Federal funds pursuant to the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program for New Construction ( 24 CFR part 880 ). Tenant ’ s share of the contract rent is $ 218 per month. The total contract rent was $ 1, 419 from July 1994 through September 1994 and $ 1, 445 from October 1994 through May 1995. Landlord seeks in this proceeding to recover tenant ’ s share of the rent for the months from July 1994 to May 1995. As a defense and counterclaim, tenant asserts that landlord breached the warranty of habitability from the inception of the tenancy in 1992. Upon a pretrial oral application, the Housing Court ruled that the diminution in the value of the apartment was to be measured based on the contract rent rather than the tenant ’ s share of the contract rent ( 164 Mise 2d 756 ). After trial, the court ruled that tenant ’ s counterclaim would be allowed only for the months for which landlord seeks to recover rent ( see also, Lin v Brabham, NYLJ, Jan. 17, 1996, at 34, col 2 [ Civ Ct, Kings County, Gould, J. ] ). Finding that the rent owed was $ 2, 398 and that the conditions in the apartment justified an award to tenant of $ 2, 300, the court granted landlord a judgment for possession and $ 98. Landlord appeals from the court ’ s pretrial determination as to the measure of damages to be applied and from the final judgment. The appeal from the pretrial determination is dismissed. Any right of direct appeal therefrom terminated with the entry of the final judgment ( see, Matter of Aho, 39 NY2d 241 ). The parties have stipulated that the sole issue to be determined on appeal is "" whether the monetary basis for calculating rent abatement due to the breach in the warranty of habitability is the full contract rent * * * or whether the abatement should be calculated based upon the tenant ’ s share, as was originally demanded in the petition for nonpayment. ” Before turning to this issue, however, we comment on the court ’ s limitation of tenant ’ s counterclaim to the months for which rent was sought by landlord. In Park W. Mgt. Corp. v Mitchell ( 47 NY2d 316, 329 ) the Court of Appeals remarked that an award for breach of the warranty of habitability may be made in an independent action by tenant or as "" a percentage reduction of the contracted - for rent as a setoff in summary nonpayment proceedings in which the tenant counterclaims or pleads as a defense breach by the landlord of his duty to maintain the premises in habitable condition. ” The Court specifically refrained from commenting "" upon the availability of other remedies ” ( at 329 ). * 343In Covington v McKeiver ( 88 Misc 2d 1000 ) the Appellate Term for the Ninth and Tenth Judicial Districts permitted the maintenance of a counterclaim based upon breach of the warranty of habitability for moneys paid under the lease ( see also, Edgemont Corp. v Audet, 170 Misc 2d 1040 [ App Term, 9th & 10th Jud Dists ] ). This is the position of the Appellate Term, First Department, as well ( see, Alp Realty Corp. v Huttick, 160 Misc 2d 76, and cases cited therein ). For the reasons that follow, we agree with this position and cases outstanding from this court which may be to the contrary should not be followed ( Fisher v Cronin, NYLJ, Feb. 1, 1990, at 29, col 5 [ App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists ] ; Fisher / Knickerbocker Co. v Green, NYLJ, May 14, 1992, at 27, col 6 [ App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists ] ). Although RPAPL 743 provides that "" [ t ] he answer may contain any legal or equitable defense, or counterclaim, ” the need for speedy dispositions in landlord - tenant matters ordinarily dictates that counterclaims be severed unless they are in essence a defense to landlord ’ s claim or so intertwined with such a defense as to become part and parcel thereof ( see, Net Realty Holding Trust v Cidis, NYLJ, Dec. 7, 1990, at 29, col 2 [ App Term, 9th & 10th Jud Dists ] ; Great Park Corp. v Goldberger, 41 Misc 2d 988 ). Where as here the same conditions provide the basis for the setoff against arrears and for the counterclaim for rent paid, the defense and counterclaim are part of the same extended transaction and the counterclaim should ordinarily not be severed ( see, Sutton Fifty - Six Co. v Fridecky, 93 AD2d 720 ; 610 W. 142nd St. Owners Corp. v Braxton, 140 Misc 2d 826 ). This appears to be the case even where the lease contains a waiver - of - counterclaims clause ( see, Sutton Fifty - Six Co. v Fridecky, supra ; Net Realty Holding Trust v Ci - dis, supra ). In the instant case, however, we are unable to grant tenant any relief on this basis in view of tenant ’ s failure to appeal and of the stipulation limiting the issues on appeal. Turning to the issue raised by the parties, it is clear to us that the diminution in the value of the apartment must be measured by reference to the contract rent. It is the contract rent and not tenant ’ s share thereof which reflects the fair market value of the apartment ( see, 42 USC § 1437f [ c ] [ 1 ] ; 24 CFR 880. 204 [ Apr. 1995 ], removed 61 Fed Reg 13587 ). The application of a measure of damages based only on tenant ’ s share of the rent would result in landlord ’ s recovery of rent in excess of the value of what he has provided tenant. To illustrate the point, let it be assumed that there had been a severe deprivation, such as that of heat and hot water, which * 344reduced the value of the apartment by half. The instant landlord, having already been paid in excess of $ 1, 200 per month by the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ), would, applying landlord ’ s proposed standard, be entitled to recover another $ 109 from tenant, or half of the tenant rent. Yet landlord would have provided tenant with an apartment worth only approximately $ 700. We find this result to be untenable. It is our view that a showing by tenant of a diminution in the value of the apartment defeats landlord ’ s claim for rent to the full extent of the diminution shown. As the Court of Appeals stated in Park W. Mgt. Corp. v Mitchell ( 47 NY2d 316, 329, supra ), the obligation to pay rent is coextensive with landlord ’ s duty to maintain the premises. To the extent that landlord breached his duty to repair, there was no rent owed and no default in rent. In the instant case, therefore, it was properly determined that the only default in rent was in the sum of $ 98. Although we are affirming, we hasten to add that we do not embrace tenant ’ s argument that a tenant should be allowed to recover damages for breach of the warranty of habitability in excess of his share of the rent ( citing Renbel Mgt. Co. v Smith, M Trial Ct, Hampden Div, index No. SP - 4384 - S87 ). The Massachusetts Housing Court reasoned that tenants were third - party beneficiaries of the contract between HUD and landlord and that to deny tenants recovery would result in a windfall to landlord. We have no quarrel with the proposition that tenant is a third - party beneficiary of the contract between HUD and landlord ( see, Free v Landrieu, 666 F2d 698 ; Holbrook v Pitt, 643 F2d 1261 ). But we do not agree with tenant and with the Massachusetts court with respect to the effect of this status upon her rights, at least insofar as are involved in this case. Tenant ’ s claim for breach of the warranty of habitability is predicated upon Real Property Law § 235 - b, which implies the warranty into tenant ’ s lease with landlord. Real Property Law § 235 - b ( 1 ) does not imply the warranty of habitability into the contract between HUD and landlord, which is not a "" lease or rental agreement. ” Moreover, the latter contract, although it does obligate landlord to maintain the premises in habitable condition, does not provide that tenant shall have a right of recovery for breach of this term. Therefore, in light of the rule that recovery for breach of the statutory warranty of habitability is dependent upon the obligation to pay rent by the party asserting the right to recover ( see, Westway Plaza Assocs. * 345v Doe, 179 AD2d 408 ; cf., Park W. Mgt. Corp. v Mitchell, supra ), it is our view that any recovery by tenant must be limited to the amount that tenant is obligated to pay as rent. Still further complexities would be presented as to the measure of damages to be applied had tenant appealed with respect to its counterclaim for rent previously paid but in view of the failure to appeal we leave consideration of that problem for another day. We reject landlord ’ s contention that tenant may not be awarded an abatement based on the full contract rent because such an award was not within the contemplation of the parties. In determining damages under Real Property Law § 235 - b it is not what the parties contemplated but what the statute provides that governs. We also reject landlord ’ s contention that HUD is a necessary party inasmuch as we have found that it is only landlord ’ s claim for rent which has been defeated and there has been no affirmative recovery by tenant. Scholnick, J. P., Chetta and Patterson, JJ., concur.",6212018," OPINION OF THE COURT Memorandum. Appeal from decision unanimously dismissed. *342Final judgment unanimously affirmed without costs. The tenant in this nonpayment proceeding resides in a building that receives Federal funds pursuant to the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program for New Construction (24 CFR part 880). Tenant’s share of the contract rent is $218 per month. The total contract rent was $1,419 from July 1994 through September 1994 and $1,445 from October 1994 through May 1995. Landlord seeks in this proceeding to recover tenant’s share of the rent for the months from July 1994 to May 1995. As a defense and counterclaim, tenant asserts that landlord breached the warranty of habitability from the inception of the tenancy in 1992. Upon a pretrial oral application, the Housing Court ruled that the diminution in the value of the apartment was to be measured based on the contract rent rather than the tenant’s share of the contract rent (164 Mise 2d 756). After trial, the court ruled that tenant’s counterclaim would be allowed only for the months for which landlord seeks to recover rent (see also, Lin v Brabham, NYLJ, Jan. 17, 1996, at 34, col 2 [Civ Ct, Kings County, Gould, J.]). Finding that the rent owed was $2,398 and that the conditions in the apartment justified an award to tenant of $2,300, the court granted landlord a judgment for possession and $98. Landlord appeals from the court’s pretrial determination as to the measure of damages to be applied and from the final judgment. The appeal from the pretrial determination is dismissed. Any right of direct appeal therefrom terminated with the entry of the final judgment (see, Matter of Aho, 39 NY2d 241). The parties have stipulated that the sole issue to be determined on appeal is ""whether the monetary basis for calculating rent abatement due to the breach in the warranty of habitability is the full contract rent * * * or whether the abatement should be calculated based upon the tenant’s share, as was originally demanded in the petition for nonpayment.” Before turning to this issue, however, we comment on the court’s limitation of tenant’s counterclaim to the months for which rent was sought by landlord. In Park W. Mgt. Corp. v Mitchell (47 NY2d 316, 329) the Court of Appeals remarked that an award for breach of the warranty of habitability may be made in an independent action by tenant or as ""a percentage reduction of the contracted-for rent as a setoff in summary nonpayment proceedings in which the tenant counterclaims or pleads as a defense breach by the landlord of his duty to maintain the premises in habitable condition.” The Court specifically refrained from commenting ""upon the availability of other remedies” (at 329). *343In Covington v McKeiver (88 Misc 2d 1000) the Appellate Term for the Ninth and Tenth Judicial Districts permitted the maintenance of a counterclaim based upon breach of the warranty of habitability for moneys paid under the lease (see also, Edgemont Corp. v Audet, 170 Misc 2d 1040 [App Term, 9th & 10th Jud Dists]). This is the position of the Appellate Term, First Department, as well (see, Alp Realty Corp. v Huttick, 160 Misc 2d 76, and cases cited therein). For the reasons that follow, we agree with this position and cases outstanding from this court which may be to the contrary should not be followed (Fisher v Cronin, NYLJ, Feb. 1, 1990, at 29, col 5 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists]; Fisher/Knickerbocker Co. v Green, NYLJ, May 14, 1992, at 27, col 6 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists]). Although RPAPL 743 provides that ""[t]he answer may contain any legal or equitable defense, or counterclaim,” the need for speedy dispositions in landlord-tenant matters ordinarily dictates that counterclaims be severed unless they are in essence a defense to landlord’s claim or so intertwined with such a defense as to become part and parcel thereof (see, Net Realty Holding Trust v Cidis, NYLJ, Dec. 7, 1990, at 29, col 2 [App Term, 9th & 10th Jud Dists]; Great Park Corp. v Goldberger, 41 Misc 2d 988). Where as here the same conditions provide the basis for the setoff against arrears and for the counterclaim for rent paid, the defense and counterclaim are part of the same extended transaction and the counterclaim should ordinarily not be severed (see, Sutton Fifty-Six Co. v Fridecky, 93 AD2d 720; 610 W. 142nd St. Owners Corp. v Braxton, 140 Misc 2d 826). This appears to be the case even where the lease contains a waiver-of-counterclaims clause (see, Sutton Fifty-Six Co. v Fridecky, supra; Net Realty Holding Trust v Ci-dis, supra). In the instant case, however, we are unable to grant tenant any relief on this basis in view of tenant’s failure to appeal and of the stipulation limiting the issues on appeal. Turning to the issue raised by the parties, it is clear to us that the diminution in the value of the apartment must be measured by reference to the contract rent. It is the contract rent and not tenant’s share thereof which reflects the fair market value of the apartment (see, 42 USC § 1437f [c] [1]; 24 CFR 880.204 [Apr. 1995], removed 61 Fed Reg 13587). The application of a measure of damages based only on tenant’s share of the rent would result in landlord’s recovery of rent in excess of the value of what he has provided tenant. To illustrate the point, let it be assumed that there had been a severe deprivation, such as that of heat and hot water, which *344reduced the value of the apartment by half. The instant landlord, having already been paid in excess of $1,200 per month by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), would, applying landlord’s proposed standard, be entitled to recover another $109 from tenant, or half of the tenant rent. Yet landlord would have provided tenant with an apartment worth only approximately $700. We find this result to be untenable. It is our view that a showing by tenant of a diminution in the value of the apartment defeats landlord’s claim for rent to the full extent of the diminution shown.

Co. v Smith, M Trial Ct, Hampden Div, index No. SP-4384-S87). The Massachusetts Housing Court reasoned that tenants were third-party beneficiaries of the contract between HUD and landlord and that to deny tenants recovery would result in a windfall to landlord. We have no quarrel with the proposition that tenant is a third-party beneficiary of the contract between HUD and landlord (see, Free v Landrieu, 666 F2d 698; Holbrook v Pitt, 643 F2d 1261). But we do not agree with tenant and with the Massachusetts court with respect to the effect of this status upon her rights, at least insofar as are involved in this case.

3567110_1,4216,"This is an appeal from a judgment in favor of the city of Newark, respondent here, defendant below, and * Page 324 against the appellants in an ejectment suit brought by the latter in the Essex County Circuit Court to recover possession of a tract of land with a frontage of thirty feet and a depth of sixty - two feet, located on the north side of Commerce street, in the city of Newark. The facts were stipulated and the case was, by consent, submitted to and determined by the court without a jury. The appellants claim in the right of Christian R. Wolters, Sr., who was the owner of the property in 1888 but is now dead. On April 14th, 1888, the city, having theretofore negotiated unsuccessfully with Wolters for the purchase of the premises, filed its petition for the appointment of condemnation commissioners and in due season prosecuted the proceeding to an award of $ 20, 000 in favor of Wolters. Wolters appealed from that award and on the appeal was granted $ 25, 466. The city thereupon paid the last mentioned sum to Wolters and, by virtue of the consummation of the condemnation proceedings, entered into and upon the premises and used the same, together with other adjoining premises, for market purposes. The proceedings to acquire the property were under an act entitled "" An act to authorize the purchase and condemnation of land and the erection of buildings for market purposes in the cities of this state and other places in which market facilities are or may be required for public use, and to provide therefor, "" passed April 22d 1886. Pamph. L. 1886, ch. 191, p. 268. The statute provides in part : "" 1. That whenever in the judgment of the common council or other governing body of any city, additional market facilities are or may be required for public uses, it shall and may be lawful for such council or other governing body to appoint five commissioners, who shall serve without any compensation, to purchase such lands and erect suitable buildings thereon, to be used as a public market. "" * * * * * * * "" 3. That in case it should in any case be found that suitable property cannot be purchased by agreement with the owner or owners, or in case the price demanded by such * Page 325 owner or owners is, in the judgment of the commissioners, in any case exorbitant, and more than a fair equivalent therefor, then the said commissioners shall report the same, with a description of the said lands, to the common council or other governing body, and the said council or other governing body may order and direct the condemnation thereof. "" * * * * * * * "" 5. That the said [ condemnation ] commissioners appointed by the Circuit Court * * * shall forthwith proceed to estimate and determine the fair value of the lands and real estate so to be taken and condemned as aforesaid, and of the damages which the owner or owners thereof will suffer by reason of the taking thereof * * * and immediately upon the payment to said owner or owners of the amount of the said valuation, or in case he or they will not or cannot receive the same, upon deposit of the same in such bank or institution as the said court or judge may direct, the title to and the right of possession of such property shall immediately become vested in such city or place ; and any owner conceiving himself or herself aggrieved by the proceedings of said commissioners, may appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of this state at any time within sixty days after the filing of the said certificate, and the said court shall thereupon order a trial by jury to assess the value of the said property and the said damages, which trial shall be conducted in all respects as in other cases of trial by jury, and the final judgment of the said court upon the verdict rendered therein shall be conclusive upon all parties as to the said valuation and damages * * *. "" * * * * * * * "" 6. That all titles taken for the purposes mentioned in this act shall be in the name of the city or place in which the lands are purchased and the buildings erected by virtue of the provisions of this act. "" Section 7 provides for the payment of condemnation commisioners. Section 8 provides for the raising of funds "" to pay for the land so purchased or condemned, and for the damages for * Page 326 the taking thereof, and for the cost of such buildings and other expenses connected therewith, "" and directs the commissioners for the improvement ( to be distinguished from the condemnation commissioners ) to "" make a full and detailed statement of the entire cost of the lands purchased, the buildings erected, and all of the expenses incurred by them. "" Paragraph 9 provides "" that the net revenues from all lands and buildings used for market purposes in every such city or place shall be devoted exclusively to the payment of the interest which may accrue upon the said bonds, and to a sinking fund for their redemption and payment when due * * *. "" For approximately thirty - five years the lands were used by the city for market purposes, and it is not contended that Wolters or his heirs had, or claimed, any possession or any right of possession during the period of that use. Then a new market place was elsewhere instituted by the city. The buildings and structures of the old market were demolished and the lands were put to new uses. The lands in question, with an adjoining lot involved in concurrent litigation, were, by ordinance adopted by the city of Newark on or about March 21st, 1924, opened as a public street, to be known as Commerce Court and to extend from Commerce street to South Canal street. The major points presented by appellants are, first, that the city of Newark took but an easement in the property, second, that if the city did acquire a fee, it was a conditional, base or determinable fee, and, finally, that in either event the use for which the property was condemned has been abandoned and, in consequence, the property has reverted to the former owner. The city responds that, by virtue of the condemnation proceedings, it acquired an estate in fee - simple absolute, the title to which is not subject to any right of reversion, and, furthermore, that even though the city be found to possess only a qualified fee, it may nevertheless devote the land to the street use. * Page 327 It may be said of a municipality, as it was said of a railroad corporation in Currie v. New York Transit Company and National Docks Railway Co., 66 N. J. Eq. 313, that the quantity of interest in land obtained by it under the power of eminent domain is that which the statute conferring the power authorizes it to acquire and that the legislature may authorize the taking of a fee or any less estate in its discretion. The earlier cases were reviewed by our Chief Justice in the opinion written by him for this court in the Currie case and need not be here adverted to in the continued recognition of the enunciated principle. The next question is : What quantity of interest did the statute which conferred the power of eminent domain authorize the city to acquire? The statute is to be read, not under the necessity of finding fixed phraseology, but to ascertain its intent, because this intent, clearly found, will prevail. No precise words are necessary in a statute to authorize the condemnation of a fee. As was said by Mr. Justice Holmes, then a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in City of Newton v. Perry, 163 Mass. 319 ; 39 N. E. Rep. 1032, "" there are no sacramental words which must be used in a statutory power to take and hold lands in order to give a right to take the lands in fee. "" See, also, Driscoll v. City of New Haven ( Conn. ), 52 Atl. Rep. 618. The statute, from its title throughout, anticipates the exercise of complete control over the lands by the city. The city is authorized to erect suitable buildings without limitation as to character or extent except that they shall be suitable to their purpose. The revenues from all such lands and buildings are to be devoted exclusively to the payment of accruing interest on, or toward the redemption of, the bonds issued by the city to finance the enterprise. Thus, dominion over the land and its increment is in, or for the advantage of, the city. The land is not for the indiscriminate use of all the inhabitants of the city, as for instance is a highway, or as is even a park, but is for such selective use as must be maintained when market space is to be let and revenues therefrom collected. * Page 328 The commissioners in condemnation are required by the statute to determine the fair value of the "" lands and real estate "" to be taken and if their award be appealed from the trial by jury shall be to assess "" the value of the said property "" — provisions not inconsistent with the taking of an estate of inheritance. Significance must attach to the statutory expression "" the title to and the right of possession of such property shall immediately become vested in such city. "" It is "" the title "" of which the statute speaks and that is a phrase which by common acceptance, as well as in the books, means full title. Bouvier defines "" title, "" as applied to lands, to be "" the means whereby the owner of lands hath the just possession of his property. "" Webster ' s New International Dictionary gives the primary definition of the word in its law use thus : "" The union of all the elements which constitute ownership, at common law divided into possession, right of possession and right of property, the last two now, however, being considered essentially the same. "" Likewise "" vest "" is a word of substantial import and is thus defined by Bouvier : "" To give an immediate fixed right of present or future enjoyment. An estate is vested in possession when there exists a right of present enjoyment ; and an estate is vested in interest when there is a present fixed right of future enjoyment. "" The provision in section eight that the city commissioners supervising the improvement shall make a "" statement of the entire cost of the lands purchased, the buildings erected and of all the expenses incurred by them "" uses the word "" purchased "" as inclusive of "" condemned ; "" that is to say, the legislature, in this respect at least, did not distinguish between purchase and condemnation. Nothing in the statute bears the ear - mark of an easement. There are certain public uses, of which the highway is a conspicuous instance, that are and long have been regarded as easements, wherein the ownership of, and limited dominion over, the land remains in him upon whose lands the servitude is impressed. Such a servitude, viewed from the angle of the servient lands, and such an easement, viewed from the * Page 329 angle of the property or the persons in favor of which or in whom the right exists, have been, from time immemorial, ascribed to the right of passage or the right of way ( vide the iter, actus and via of the Roman law ). A line of our decisions, of which the most recent is Frelinghuysen v. State Highway Commission, 107 N. J. L. 218 ; affirmed, post, p. 403, have established that when the state takes the property of its citizens for highway purposes, it takes an easement only. This easement is primarily a right of passage, and while secondary uses are sustained as related thereto, nevertheless the fact of passage remains the touchstone ; and, therefore, an unrelated use may not be made of the highway against the consent of the private owner of the fee, except by condemnation under the power of eminent domain. Nicoll v. Telephone Co., 62 N. J. L. 733. But there is an inherent cleavage between such an easement, or indeed between any easement, and the estate that comes to a municipality under acquisition of lands for a purpose that may endure forever and that, while it lasts, embraces exclusive possession and exclusive right of possession. The purview of the statute may not, we think, be cramped into an easement or a right in the nature of an easement. The city was authorized to acquire a fee. Having that authority, what did the city reach out to take, what did it in fact take and what did it pay for? It negotiated with Wolters, not for a right to use lands, but for the purchase of "" the lands. "" That was pursuant to the appointment of city commissioners "" to purchase or condemn said lands. "" Stipulation of fact No. 3 reads in part : "" Pursuant to the provisions of said act, the common council of the city of Newark, on September 2d 1887, appointed commissioners to purchase or condemn said lands, and entered into negotiations with Christian R. Wolters, Sr., the owner of said premises, for the purchase thereof, but failed to agree with him as to the price to be paid to him for said lands. "" The commissioners for the improvement then proceeded to condemn that which the city had been unable to purchase, namely, "" the lands "" — more specifically, the lands which the * Page 330 city entered into the complete and exclusive possession of in 1888, over which the city has exercised undisputed dominion from thence hitherto, and which are described in the complaint in the instant cause. The city acted to acquire the entire quantity and extent of interest permitted by the statute. That full measure of estate was necessary for the character of improvement and use contemplated by the statute and actually put into effect by the city. It is claimed that there is no evidence that the owner received the full value of his lands. To this it may be said that there is no evidence that full value was not paid and that the amount of the award, regard being had for the size and location of the lot and the period of the transaction, does not carry intrinsic indicia of insufficiency ; that on the contrary the statute required the fair value of the lands to be determined and paid ; that the owner on his appeal from the original award obtained an increase of more than twenty - five per centum in the determination of value ; that the last mentioned verdict was paid to and received by him ; that by the statute that verdict was made "" conclusive upon all the parties as to the said valuation ; "" and that consequently, on the theory of res adjudicata, the appellants are bound by this finding of value. There is no suggestion that the acquisition, the use or the change was mala fide. There is no taint of fraud or of concealed purpose to negative a result otherwise reached. The city took the lands in fee. It remains to consider the effect, if any, of the change in use. It is not charged that the new use is a greater burden on the lands or that it results in a greater deprivation to those who claim a reversion. The claim is merely that the use is different ; and manifestly it is different ; and the former use is, we find, abandoned. But the new use is a public use for which the power of condemnation is available ; and inasmuch as the owner was paid the fair value of the lands, just compensation has been made. Changes, incident to the passing of the years, may cause a tract of land, originally taken for market uses, to serve a better public purpose as a * Page 331 site for a fire house and still later for a municipal court house. In the case at bar it chanced that the public was more efficiently served by changing the use to that of a street. It would, we think, be an exaggeration of the essence of private ownership and a mulcting of the public purse to hold that when an individual has had his lands taken for public use and has been fully paid for those lands he, or his heirs after him, should be entitled to payment anew whenever the character of the public use changes, simply because it does change. The Supreme Court opinion in Paterson v. Kearny, 84 N. J. L. 456 ( affirmed, 87 Id. 327, in part on the opinion below ), is cited contra. The issue was the right of the town of Kearny to proceed with the condemnation of land for a water supply. The Supreme Court found that the city was proceeding in good faith under statutory authority and held that the action was legal. Its opinion contains this sentence : "" If that was not the real object, or if the water is diverted to some other use not authorized, the right acquired will be at an end, just as land reverts to the prior owner when the use for which it is condemned is abandoned. "" That language was predicated upon a hypothesis that did not grow out of the determined facts of the case and that therefore was not before the court for decision. It was obiter. Also, the assumed contingencies of bad faith and putting the lands to a use for which the municipality is not authorized to condemn are not present in the instant case. The Supreme Court in Strock v. East Orange, 80 N. J. L. 619 ; 77 Atl. Rep. 1051, speaking through Mr. Justice Parker observed that : "" When land has been acquired for public use, as for a park, by condemnation and payment to the owner of its full value, or by sale and purchase, it seems to be competent for the legislature to authorize the municipality so acquiring it to use it for other purposes. Brooklyn Park Commissioners v. Armstrong, 45 N. Y. 235 ; 6 Am. Rep. 70. "" The New York Court of Appeals in the cited case says : "" Where the property is taken, the owner paid its true * Page 332 value, and the title vested in the public it owns the whole property, and not merely the use ; and though the particular use may be abandoned, the right to the property remains. The property is still held in trust for the public by the authorities. By legislative sanction it may be sold, be changed in its character from realty to personalty, and the avails be devoted to general or special public purposes. "" We conclude that when a municipality has, in good faith, by condemnation, under legislative authority, taken title in fee to lands for a public use, and has paid the full value thereof, the fee is not determined by the fact that the municipality abandons the specific use for which the lands were taken and devotes the lands to another public use. We find that the city of Newark paid the full price of the lands ; that it intended to, and did take the title in fee and that the fee was not determined by the fact that the city abandoned the market use and devoted the lands to street purposes. The city of Newark has attempted neither to dispose of the lands nor to apply them to other than a public use. Therefore it is not necessary to decide whether the title held by the city is a fee - simple absolute or is of the class described as fee - simple determinable. Pipe Line Co. v. Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co., 62 N. J. L. 254, 268. The judgment below will be affirmed.

For reversal — PARKER, KAYS, JJ. 2. * Page 333",3567110,"This is an appeal from a judgment in favor of the city of Newark, respondent here, defendant below, and *Page 324 against the appellants in an ejectment suit brought by the latter in the Essex County Circuit Court to recover possession of a tract of land with a frontage of thirty feet and a depth of sixty-two feet, located on the north side of Commerce street, in the city of Newark. The facts were stipulated and the case was, by consent, submitted to and determined by the court without a jury. The appellants claim in the right of Christian R. Wolters, Sr., who was the owner of the property in 1888 but is now dead. On April 14th, 1888, the city, having theretofore negotiated unsuccessfully with Wolters for the purchase of the premises, filed its petition for the appointment of condemnation commissioners and in due season prosecuted the proceeding to an award of $20,000 in favor of Wolters. Wolters appealed from that award and on the appeal was granted $25,466. The city thereupon paid the last mentioned sum to Wolters and, by virtue of the consummation of the condemnation proceedings, entered into and upon the premises and used the same, together with other adjoining premises, for market purposes. The proceedings to acquire the property were under an act entitled ""An act to authorize the purchase and condemnation of land and the erection of buildings for market purposes in the cities of this state and other places in which market facilities are or may be required for public use, and to provide therefor,"" passed April 22d 1886. Pamph. L. 1886, ch. 191, p. 268. The statute provides in part: ""1. That whenever in the judgment of the common council or other governing body of any city, additional market facilities are or may be required for public uses, it shall and may be lawful for such council or other governing body to appoint five commissioners, who shall serve without any compensation, to purchase such lands and erect suitable buildings thereon, to be used as a public market."" * * * * * * * ""3. That in case it should in any case be found that suitable property cannot be purchased by agreement with the owner or owners, or in case the price demanded by such *Page 325 owner or owners is, in the judgment of the commissioners, in any case exorbitant, and more than a fair equivalent therefor, then the said commissioners shall report the same, with a description of the said lands, to the common council or other governing body, and the said council or other governing body may order and direct the condemnation thereof."" * * * * * * * ""5. That the said [condemnation] commissioners appointed by the Circuit Court * * * shall forthwith proceed to estimate and determine the fair value of the lands and real estate so to be taken and condemned as aforesaid, and of the damages which the owner or owners thereof will suffer by reason of the taking thereof * * * and immediately upon the payment to said owner or owners of the amount of the said valuation, or in case he or they will not or cannot receive the same, upon deposit of the same in such bank or institution as the said court or judge may direct, the title to and the right of possession of such property shall immediately become vested in such city or place; and any owner conceiving himself or herself aggrieved by the proceedings of said commissioners, may appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of this state at any time within sixty days after the filing of the said certificate, and the said court shall thereupon order a trial by jury to assess the value of the said property and the said damages, which trial shall be conducted in all respects as in other cases of trial by jury, and the final judgment of the said court upon the verdict rendered therein shall be conclusive upon all parties as to the said valuation and damages * * *."" * * * * * * * ""6. That all titles taken for the purposes mentioned in this act shall be in the name of the city or place in which the lands are purchased and the buildings erected by virtue of the provisions of this act."" Section 7 provides for the payment of condemnation commisioners. Section 8 provides for the raising of funds ""to pay for the land so purchased or condemned, and for the damages for *Page 326 the taking thereof, and for the cost of such buildings and other expenses connected therewith,"" and directs the commissioners for the improvement (to be distinguished from the condemnation commissioners) to ""make a full and detailed statement of the entire cost of the lands purchased, the buildings erected, and all of the expenses incurred by them."" Paragraph 9 provides ""that the net revenues from all lands and buildings used for market purposes in every such city or place shall be devoted exclusively to the payment of the interest which may accrue upon the said bonds, and to a sinking fund for their redemption and payment when due * * *."" For approximately thirty-five years the lands were used by the city for market purposes, and it is not contended that Wolters or his heirs had, or claimed, any possession or any right of possession during the period of that use. Then a new market place was elsewhere instituted by the city. The buildings and structures of the old market were demolished and the lands were put to new uses. The lands in question, with an adjoining lot involved in concurrent litigation, were, by ordinance adopted by the city of Newark on or about March 21st, 1924, opened as a public street, to be known as Commerce Court and to extend from Commerce street to South Canal street. The major points presented by appellants are, first, that the city of Newark took but an easement in the property, second, that if the city did acquire a fee, it was a conditional, base or determinable fee, and, finally, that in either event the use for which the property was condemned has been abandoned and, in consequence, the property has reverted to the former owner. The city responds that, by virtue of the condemnation proceedings, it acquired an estate in fee-simple absolute, the title to which is not subject to any right of reversion, and, furthermore, that even though the city be found to possess only a qualified fee, it may nevertheless devote the land to the street use. *Page 327 It may be said of a municipality, as it was said of a railroad corporation in Currie v. New York Transit Company and National Docks Railway Co., 66 N.J. Eq. 313 , that the quantity of interest in land obtained by it under the power of eminent domain is that which the statute conferring the power authorizes it to acquire and that the legislature may authorize the taking of a fee or any less estate in its discretion. The earlier cases were reviewed by our Chief Justice in the opinion written by him for this court in the Currie case and need not be here adverted to in the continued recognition of the enunciated principle. The next question is: What quantity of interest did the statute which conferred the power of eminent domain authorize the city to acquire? The statute is to be read, not under the necessity of finding fixed phraseology, but to ascertain its intent, because this intent, clearly found, will prevail. No precise words are necessary in a statute to authorize the condemnation of a fee. As was said by Mr. Justice Holmes, then a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in City of Newton v. Perry , 163 Mass. 319 ; 39 N.E. Rep. 1032, ""there are no sacramental words which must be used in a statutory power to take and hold lands in order to give a right to take the lands in fee."" See, also, Driscoll v. City of New Haven (Conn.), 52 Atl. Rep. 618 . The statute, from its title throughout, anticipates the exercise of complete control over the lands by the city. The city is authorized to erect suitable buildings without limitation as to character or extent except that they shall be suitable to their purpose. The revenues from all such lands and buildings are to be devoted exclusively to the payment of accruing interest on, or toward the redemption of, the bonds issued by the city to finance the enterprise. Thus, dominion over the land and its increment is in, or for the advantage of, the city. The land is not for the indiscriminate use of all the inhabitants of the city, as for instance is a highway, or as is even a park, but is for such selective use as must be maintained when market space is to be let and revenues therefrom collected. *Page 328 The commissioners in condemnation are required by the statute to determine the fair value of the ""lands and real estate"" to be taken and if their award be appealed from the trial by jury shall be to assess ""the value of the said property"" — provisions not inconsistent with the taking of an estate of inheritance. Significance must attach to the statutory expression ""the title to and the right of possession of such property shall immediately become vested in such city."" It is ""the title"" of which the statute speaks and that is a phrase which by common acceptance, as well as in the books, means full title. Bouvier defines ""title,"" as applied to lands, to be ""the means whereby the owner of lands hath the just possession of his property."" Webster's New International Dictionary gives the primary definition of the word in its law use thus: ""The union of all the elements which constitute ownership, at common law divided into possession, right of possession and right of property, the last two now, however, being considered essentially the same."" Likewise ""vest"" is a word of substantial import and is thus defined by Bouvier: ""To give an immediate fixed right of present or future enjoyment. An estate is vested in possession when there exists a right of present enjoyment; and an estate is vested in interest when there is a present fixed right of future enjoyment."" The provision in section eight that the city commissioners supervising the improvement shall make a ""statement of the entire cost of the lands purchased , the buildings erected and of all the expenses incurred by them"" uses the word ""purchased"" as inclusive of ""condemned;"" that is to say, the legislature, in this respect at least, did not distinguish between purchase and condemnation. Nothing in the statute bears the ear-mark of an easement. There are certain public uses, of which the highway is a conspicuous instance, that are and long have been regarded as easements, wherein the ownership of, and limited dominion over, the land remains in him upon whose lands the servitude is impressed. Such a servitude, viewed from the angle of the servient lands, and such an easement, viewed from the *Page 329 angle of the property or the persons in favor of which or in whom the right exists, have been, from time immemorial, ascribed to the right of passage or the right of way ( vide the iter, actus and via of the Roman law). A line of our decisions, of which the most recent is Frelinghuysen v. State Highway Commission, 107 N.J.L. 218 ; affirmed, post, p. 403, have established that when the state takes the property of its citizens for highway purposes, it takes an easement only. This easement is primarily a right of passage, and while secondary uses are sustained as related thereto, nevertheless the fact of passage remains the touchstone; and, therefore, an unrelated use may not be made of the highway against the consent of the private owner of the fee, except by condemnation under the power of eminent domain. Nicoll v. Telephone Co., 62 N.J.L. 733 . But there is an inherent cleavage between such an easement, or indeed between any easement, and the estate that comes to a municipality under acquisition of lands for a purpose that may endure forever and that, while it lasts, embraces exclusive possession and exclusive right of possession. The purview of the statute may not, we think, be cramped into an easement or a right in the nature of an easement. The city was authorized to acquire a fee. Having that authority, what did the city reach out to take, what did it in fact take and what did it pay for? It negotiated with Wolters, not for a right to use lands, but for the purchase of ""the lands."" That was pursuant to the appointment of city commissioners ""to purchase or condemn said lands."" Stipulation of fact No. 3 reads in part: ""Pursuant to the provisions of said act, the common council of the city of Newark, on September 2d 1887, appointed commissioners to purchase or condemn said lands, and entered into negotiations with Christian R. Wolters, Sr., the owner of said premises, for the purchase thereof, but failed to agree with him as to the price to be paid to him for said lands."" The commissioners for the improvement then proceeded to condemn that which the city had been unable to purchase, namely, ""the lands"" — more specifically, the lands which the *Page 330 city entered into the complete and exclusive possession of in 1888, over which the city has exercised undisputed dominion from thence hitherto, and which are described in the complaint in the instant cause. The city acted to acquire the entire quantity and extent of interest permitted by the statute. That full measure of estate was necessary for the character of improvement and use contemplated by the statute and actually put into effect by the city. It is claimed that there is no evidence that the owner received the full value of his lands. To this it may be said that there is no evidence that full value was not paid and that the amount of the award, regard being had for the size and location of the lot and the period of the transaction, does not carry intrinsic indicia of insufficiency; that on the contrary the statute required the fair value of the lands to be determined and paid; that the owner on his appeal from the original award obtained an increase of more than twenty-five per centum in the determination of value; that the last mentioned verdict was paid to and received by him; that by the statute that verdict was made ""conclusive upon all the parties as to the said valuation;"" and that consequently, on the theory of res adjudicata , the appellants are bound by this finding of value. There is no suggestion that the acquisition, the use or the change was mala fide. There is no taint of fraud or of concealed purpose to negative a result otherwise reached. The city took the lands in fee. It remains to consider the effect, if any, of the change in use. It is not charged that the new use is a greater burden on the lands or that it results in a greater deprivation to those who claim a reversion. The claim is merely that the use is different; and manifestly it is different; and the former use is, we find, abandoned. But the new use is a public use for which the power of condemnation is available; and inasmuch as the owner was paid the fair value of the lands, just compensation has been made. Changes, incident to the passing of the years, may cause a tract of land, originally taken for market uses, to serve a better public purpose as a *Page 331 site for a fire house and still later for a municipal court house. In the case at bar it chanced that the public was more efficiently served by changing the use to that of a street. It would, we think, be an exaggeration of the essence of private ownership and a mulcting of the public purse to hold that when an individual has had his lands taken for public use and has been fully paid for those lands he, or his heirs after him, should be entitled to payment anew whenever the character of the public use changes, simply because it does change.

7833561_1,4620,"Bissell, P. J., delivered the opinion of the court. In the statement of what is requisite to an apprehension of the suit and to an application of the law which we conclude * 324must control its decision, we shall very closely adhere to the fkcts recited in the findings of the court. They may be occasionally supplemented by our own conclusions respecting some matters, but in no instance will there be any departure from what the trial court has stated. The force and effect of these findings are thoroughly settled. As a general proposition, parties are not entitled to attack a judgment on the claim that it is unsupported by the evidence. Wherever the controversy, in its important and essential features, rests on conflicting testimony, the appellant must be able to demonstrate error of law to maintain his appeal. Nevertheless, we have read this very voluminous record, and while we are compelled to affirm the judgment, notwithstanding our conclusion that there is enough in the case to show that, under some circumstances and with proper parties, what was done by the appellee, Chappell, would subject him to legal responsibility, we are satisfied the trial court did not err in its conclusions respecting some facts which we deem decisive of the action. In 1887, The Cincinnati - Colorado Coal, Coke and Iron Company, which is designated in the evidence and will be hereafter referred to as the Four C Company, was the owner of some lands in Las Animas county. They were coal lands, and apparently had been somewhat developed by that corporation. The company had not reached a paying basis and was without sufficient capital to proceed with the satisfactory development of the mines. At this time, the appellant, Beshoar, with some other persons, was the owner of the capital stock of the Four C Company. On behalf of his company he entered into negotiations with Chappell which looked to the organization of a new corporation on a basis which would permit funds to be raised to open up the property. The parties concluded the thing was feasible, and Chappell organized a new company called The Grey Creek Coal and Coking Company. The capital stock of this latter corporation was two thousand shares of one hundred dollars each. This new company was organized by the election of officers and a board * 325of directors, and then received from Beshoar, on behalf of himself and the stockholders of the Four C Company, a written proposition which substantially was that the Four C Company would sell to the Grey Creek Coal and Coking Company their real estate, which was described in the proposition, for one thousand shares of the capital stock of the company. In the proposition nothing whatever was said in regard to the remaining thousand shares. The evidence, however, discloses that it was in the contemplation of the parties that the thousand shares of stock should be sold at sixty cents on the dollar to produce a development fund of sixty thousand dollars, which should be devoted to opening up the property. Evidently the stockholders of the Four C Company were willing to surrender one half of their holdings for this purpose, and in place of cancelling, transferring or surrendering any of the Four C Company ’ s stock, pursued this plan. There were some limitations of time which were to control Chappell in his scheme to float the new company, but this is not important to the dispute. This proposition was submitted at a directors ’ meeting, held on the 22d of September, 1887. It was accepted, and what was done by the Grey Creek Company will be assumed to be enough to secure them in their legal rights. The project was carried out by the Four C Company, which conveyed the lands to the other corporation. The capital stock of the Grej1 - Creek Company was issued, nine hundred shares of it went to Beshoar, according to the arrangement, one hundred which he had agreed to give Chappell for his services in the premises were turned over to him, and the remaining thousand shares were left for sale to raise the development fund. The trial court finds that this thousand shares of stock was sold by Chappell for sixty thousand dollars in cash, which went into the treasury of the company, and was applied by its officers and directory to the development of the lands which had been transferred. In stating this fact, we do not express our opinion concerning its just - mess. We expressly decline to yield our assent to the result respecting this matter, for we desire that the affirmance shall * 326not extend so far as to conclude anjr parties in any subsequent litigation which may be instituted regarding it. The stock was deposited in the First National Bank of Trinidad, subject to sale and payment of the subscription price, and when the whole sum of sixty thousand dollars was paid in and properly applied, the stock was turned over to the purchasers. The court finds the money was actually put into the development of the property. To illustrate the animus and modus, we must now state what is really the occasion of the suits. On the 26th of September, a written agreement was entered into between The Colorado Coal and Iron Company and Chappell, which need only be stated to disclose the hidden motives. It was recited therein that Chappell had procured from Beshoar and others an option on a controlling interest in the stock of the Grey Creek Company, and he undertook to obtain from that company a lease of the estate for a term of twenty years on sundry conditions. The only one of importance is that which looked to the expenditure of money for the development of the property. The Colorado Coal and Iron Company undertook to spend sixty thousand dollars for this purpose. It will be observed there was a very strange coincidence between the amount which The C. C. & I. Co. agreed to spend and the sum for which Chappell undertook to sell the Grey Creek Company ’ s stock. The evidence likewise disclosed that as fast as money was disbursed by him as an officer of the Grey Creek Company in payment of the bills which were incurred in the development, these vouchers were turned over to the manager of The C. C. & I. Co., who honored them by checks of that corporation for their face value. It thus resulted that what Chappell paid out with bis right hand for the Grey Creek Company he instantly got back in his left from The C. C. & I. Co. On the 27th of September, which was the day following the execution of the agreement between Chappell and The C. C. & I. Co., the Grey Creek Company and The C. C. & I. Co. made an agreement of a lease which contained the provisions and various conditions specified in the agreement bet ween. Chappell and * 327that corporation. It was executed by the lessors, through Chappell, the vice president, and by the proper officers on behalf of The C. C. & I. Co. Under the provisions of this lease, The C. C. & I. Co. spent sixty thousand dollars, opened up the property, paid royalties from time to time, but in the end suspended operations. The transaction concerning this stock is not creditable to the appellee, Chappell, and we cannot close our mental vision to what is so evident from the record that the scheme was one cunningly devised for the appropriation without cost to. him of one half of the capital stock of the Grey Creek Company. This in no wise militates against what we said at the outset concerning the force of the court ’ s conclusion on matters of fact, because our. opinion in no wise affects the legal result which we have reached. We have simply given expression to our doubts respecting this matter, for, if the thing be possible, we desire to so far leave the matter open that the Grey Creek Company may ultimately be able to establish and enforce its rights. We have stated enough to show the alleged basis for the suits which Beshoar afterwards brought. Beshoar claims that for a long time he was ignorant of the situation, and without knowledge of what Chappell had done with reference to the disposition of the Grey Creek Company ’ s stock, and was uninformed concerning this contract between The C. C. & I. Co. and Chappell. There was a change in the management of The C. C. & I. Co., and in the investigations which followed it, this agreement between Chappell and the company came to the surface, and Beshoar learned of it. How little or how much he knew before of the transaction is not easily ascertained from the testimony. The record shows the lease to The C. C. & I. Co. was made in February, 1. 888, and shortly thereafter that company went into possession of the property, and engaged in its development. Beshoar knew of the lease, and had frequent conferences with Chappell concerning its terms. Whether he had any other information which should have advised him concerning the exact nature of the transaction is not apparent. * 328He was not told of this contract between Chappell and The C. C. & I. Co., nor did he learn of it until about the middle of 1890, when he was fully advised concerning its existence and its terms. After the resurrection of this agreement, Beshoar and The C. C. & I. Co. made an arrangement to start a litigation to hold Chappell responsible for what he had done, and establish Beshoar ’ s rights as a stockholder, for the benefit both of Beshoar and The C. C. & I. Co. The arrangement which was made provided substantially for the advancement to Beshoar of six thousand dollars, or, at all events, he was in some way to receive that amount of money, and The C. C. & I. Co. undertook the prosecution of such suits as might be necessary to establish Beshoar ’ s rights. The C. C. & I. Co. were to pay all costs, furnish an attorney, and, in general, maintain the prosecution. Thereupon, three suits were begun. The first we will call “ 3209, ” the second “ 3362, ” which are cases by Beshoar against divers defendants, and the third “ 3218, ” which is the Grey Creek Company against Beshoar and MacKenzie. We will only state enough of the purposes of these actions, to illustrate their scope and the object of the pleader. In the first, Beshoar charged that Chappell had sold one thousand shares of stock and appropriated the proceeds to his own use ; further, that he had issued other stock and disposed of it, appropriating the results of the sales. In “ 3362, ” Beshoar charged that all the stock which had been issued, other than that which had come to him, had been issued without any consideration whatever, and was fraudulent and void in the holder ’ s hands, and he sought to have it cancelled, thereby increasing the value of his own holdings. In “ 3218, ” the Grey Creek Company charged that some certificates of stock had been irregularly issued, and had illegally come into the possession of Beshoar, and his refusal to surrender them for cancellation. The company prayed a decree that Beshoar be compelled to surrender them for destruction. All these three suits were ultimately consolidated and tried as one case. There was no rule compelling the parties to replead, nor * 329were the issues in the several suits in any wise changed by the order. Nothing farther need be stated concerning the object of the suits, or the general averments of the various pleadings. This much further must be stated, because it is of great gravity and importance in forcing the result. It will be observed nothing has been said concerning any statement in the pleadings as to the reason why the suit was brought by Beshoar, and why it was not brought by the Grey Creek Company against Chappell. It is very evident, as a general proposition, that if Chappell had sold the stock of the company while acting as an officer or director of it, or had appropriated the proceeds of it while acting in any such capacity, he would be liable to answer to the company for whatever he might have received. It is equally true, if he had issued the stock without consideration, and the stock had ultimately come back into his possession, the company would have had the legal right to compel its surrender and cancellation on making out a proper case. Beshoar was a stockholder, and, to the extent of his holding, interested in the affairs, management and prosperity of the new company. His rights as a stockholder need not be here discussed, but they are referred to in this manner to emphasize the omission in his pleading. There is nothing in either of the complaints which he filed showing a demand on the officers of the Grey Creek Company with reference to the enforcement of the corporate rights, nor did he, as plaintiff, allege, in either one of the suits, anything which might operate by way of excuse for the omission of this request. There is nothing to show an attempt to secure action by the officers or board of directors of the company, or concurrent action with the other Stockholders to compel those people to proceed. The twenty - first finding of fact is very specific and direct on this point. It likewise demonstrates that the directors of the Grey Creek Company, other than Chappell, were in no manner connected with the contract which Chappell had made with The C. C. & I. Co., and were perfectly free to act as they might be advised for the protection of the stockholders of the corporation * 330■which they represented. We quite concur with the court in its conclusion that the evidence does not show any such condition of affairs respecting the management and directory of the Grey Creek Company as tends to excuse the stockholder from preferring a request for corporate action. What has been stated suggests the only two propositions which we deem it essential to discuss or decide. The first respects the interest in which the litigation is being prosecuted, and the second is the failure of the plaintiff to either plead or prove a cause of action on his behalf as a stockholder. If this litigation had been honestly instituted by a stockholder for the protection of his and other stockholders ’ rights, and was not so evidently a suit instigated by a rival company for its own interests, we should strive to be astute to discover some remedy for a very evident wrong. The far reaching and flexible nature of equitable powers might, with proper proof and under other circumstances, enable us to do justice as between the stockholders of the Grey Creek Company and Chappell, its officer and director. But we have no inclination to struggle for this result, because it is a well settled principle that whenever it is made to appear that the suit was. not begun in good faith by a shareholder for the protection of his rights, but was in reality originated and prosecuted by another corporation for its own benefit, the court will consider what led the plaintiff to institute his suit, and, finding some other reason than a desire to protect stockholders ’ rights, will refuse to entertain the bill. Forrest v. Manchester, etc., R ' way Co., 4 De G., F. & J. 19 ( 65 Eng. Chan., 125 ) ; Filder v. London, etc., R ' way Co., 1 H. & M. 489 ; Belmont v. Erie R ' way Co. et al., 52 Barb. 637 ; Waterbury v. The Merchants ’ Union Express Co., 50 Barb. 157 ; Camblos v. The P. & R. R. R. Co., 4 Brewster, 563. Naturally, the cases respecting this proposition are limited, since the question could not often arise. It seldom happens that shareholders, otherwise than for the protection of their own interests, come into courts of equity to seek redress for wrongs done the corporation of which they are * 331members. But wherever it is apparent that this has been done, the courts have never hesitated to send the plaintiff out of court and refuse him relief. In enforcing the doctrine, the courts do not attempt to balance the relative advantages to the plaintiff stockholder, or to the company which has assumed the burden of the litigation, for some benefit which they expect to derive from the judgment. It is enough that another company directs the suit and pays the costs. It would be very easy to demonstrate that in this particular litigation the balance of advantage accrued to The C. C. & I. Co., which is the controlling spirit in this litigation. The agreement which they entered into with Beshoar would give them control of a majority of the stock of the Grey Creek Company, and render it possible for them to enforce the. agreement which they had made with Beshoar to secure a new lease on the Grey Creek property at a very large reduction in the rental. The property must have been of value to them, and the lease a gain, or the contract would never have been made. It may be conceded that Beshoar would likewise have been benefited, if either of his two suits had been successful. In the one case a large amount of money would go into the treasury of the Grey Creek Company, and he would be entitled to his proportionate share of it ; and in the other he would become substantially the only stockholder, and would therefore reap very much greater ultimate benefit than would have come to him if the total issue of two thousand shares was adjudged valid. We are not permitted to speculate about where the preponderating interest lies. It would be a disadvantage to the Grey Creek Company, as a corporation, to reduce the rental which they were entitled to receive for the use and occupancy of their property. This benefit would have inured to The C. C. & I. Co., which controls the litigation, and these two facts forbid this stockholder to maintain his present suit. The other consideration is equally fatal. The plaintiff was without capacity to maintain the suit. It is too late now to insist that a stockholder as such is never without the right * 332to file a bill for the protection of his interests, or even for the redress of what may be termed a corporate wrong. In the increasing diversity of corporate organizations, it not infrequently happens that the control and management of their affairs fall into the hands of unscrupulous persons, who do not hesitate to use the corporate powers to their personal advantage, and to the destruction of the rights of co - stockholders. This increasing danger and difficulty has often led to the institution of suits for the protection of stockholders. The powers of a court, of equity are not often vainly sought to redress a manifest injury where the corporate authorities have refused to proceed. This is no infraction of the general rule that corporations must act by properly constituted authority and organization, and by corporate methods and in corporate ways. The necessity of effort to procure such action has been settled by a series of well considered cases. The question was set at rest in this state in an exceedingly well considered and able opinion by the present chief justice of the supreme court. To the fullest extent that learned court indorsed the doctrine of the English cases, and expressed its approval of the leading case in the supreme court of the United States. Miller et al. v. Murray, 17 Colo. 408 ; Hawes v. Oakland, 104 U. S. 450 ; Foss v. Harbottle, 24 Eng. Chan. 461 ; MacDougal v. Gardiner, 1 L. R. Chan. D. 13 ; Memphis City v. Dean, 8 Wall. 65. Tested by this rale, none of the suits brought by Beshoar can be maintained. His pleadings are totally wanting in all averments, either of request or of excuse, and, being bills on behalf of a stockholder to redress a corporate injury, they do not state a cause of action. We might be inclined to disregard this defect if the case as he made it contained the elements of an excuse for his failure. None was proven and none exists. The court very properly found that none of the other directors or officers of the Grey Creek Company were concerned in the contract which Chappell made with the C. C. & I. corporation, or had anything whatever to do with reference to those acts which Beshoar charges were a * 333fraud on the Grey Creek Company. It was found that Beshoar made no request of the Grey Creek officers or directors to institute a suit against Chappell to compel him either to account for the stock or the money which he had received from the sale of it. As Chappell was the onty person concerned in the diversion of the funds or in the appropriation of the stock, we cannot presume that the Grey Creek Company as a corporation, would have failed on request to institute the proper suit for the enforcement of the corporate rights. It was Beshoar ’ s duty to show that he had exerted all means within his power to obtain by corporate action the redress of his grievances. The court must be satisfied that all honest and reasonable efforts were resorted to to the accomplishment of that end. Failing in this, he will not be permitted to maintain his suit. There is nothing in the present case which brings the plaintiff within the rule, and there is no testimony in the record which permits us to assert for his benefit what, under other circumstances, might prove operative as an excuse. The suit was, not honestly instituted by Beshoar for his own benefit, and he was without capacity to maintain it. The judgment as to him must be affirmed. We desire, however, to state that this affirmance shall not be operative to conclude the Grey Creek Company, or any stockholder of that corporation, from instituting and maintaining such suit as they may be advised concerning this matter, providing otherwise the legal right still remains with them. Affirmed.",7833561," Bissell, P. J., delivered the opinion of the court. In the statement of what is requisite to an apprehension of the suit and to an application of the law which we conclude *324must control its decision, we shall very closely adhere to the fkcts recited in the findings of the court. They may be occasionally supplemented by our own conclusions respecting some matters, but in no instance will there be any departure from what the trial court has stated. The force and effect of these findings are thoroughly settled. As a general proposition, parties are not entitled to attack a judgment on the claim that it is unsupported by the evidence. Wherever the controversy, in its important and essential features, rests on conflicting testimony, the appellant must be able to demonstrate error of law to maintain his appeal. Nevertheless, we have read this very voluminous record, and while we are compelled to affirm the judgment, notwithstanding our conclusion that there is enough in the case to show that, under some circumstances and with proper parties, what was done by the appellee, Chappell, would subject him to legal responsibility, we are satisfied the trial court did not err in its conclusions respecting some facts which we deem decisive of the action. In 1887, The Cincinnati-Colorado Coal, Coke and Iron Company, which is designated in the evidence and will be hereafter referred to as the Four C Company, was the owner of some lands in Las Animas county. They were coal lands, and apparently had been somewhat developed by that corporation. The company had not reached a paying basis and was without sufficient capital to proceed with the satisfactory development of the mines. At this time, the appellant, Beshoar, with some other persons, was the owner of the capital stock of the Four C Company. On behalf of his company he entered into negotiations with Chappell which looked to the organization of a new corporation on a basis which would permit funds to be raised to open up the property. The parties concluded the thing was feasible, and Chappell organized a new company called The Grey Creek Coal and Coking Company. The capital stock of this latter corporation was two thousand shares of one hundred dollars each. This new company was organized by the election of officers and a board *325of directors, and then received from Beshoar, on behalf of himself and the stockholders of the Four C Company, a written proposition which substantially was that the Four C Company would sell to the Grey Creek Coal and Coking Company their real estate, which was described in the proposition, for one thousand shares of the capital stock of the company. In the proposition nothing whatever was said in regard to the remaining thousand shares. The evidence, however, discloses that it was in the contemplation of the parties that the thousand shares of stock should be sold at sixty cents on the dollar to produce a development fund of sixty thousand dollars, which should be devoted to opening up the property. Evidently the stockholders of the Four C Company were willing to surrender one half of their holdings for this purpose, and in place of cancelling, transferring or surrendering any of the Four C Company’s stock, pursued this plan. There were some limitations of time which were to control Chappell in his scheme to float the new company, but this is not important to the dispute. This proposition was submitted at a directors’ meeting, held on the 22d of September, 1887. It was accepted, and what was done by the Grey Creek Company will be assumed to be enough to secure them in their legal rights. The project was carried out by the Four C Company, which conveyed the lands to the other corporation. The capital stock of the Grej1- Creek Company was issued, nine hundred shares of it went to Beshoar, according to the arrangement, one hundred which he had agreed to give Chappell for his services in the premises were turned over to him, and the remaining thousand shares were left for sale to raise the development fund. The trial court finds that this thousand shares of stock was sold by Chappell for sixty thousand dollars in cash, which went into the treasury of the company, and was applied by its officers and directory to the development of the lands which had been transferred. In stating this fact, we do not express our opinion concerning its just-mess. We expressly decline to yield our assent to the result respecting this matter, for we desire that the affirmance shall *326not extend so far as to conclude anjr parties in any subsequent litigation which may be instituted regarding it. The stock was deposited in the First National Bank of Trinidad, subject to sale and payment of the subscription price, and when the whole sum of sixty thousand dollars was paid in and properly applied, the stock was turned over to the purchasers. The court finds the money was actually put into the development of the property. To illustrate the animus and modus, we must now state what is really the occasion of the suits. On the 26th of September, a written agreement was entered into between The Colorado Coal and Iron Company and Chappell, which need only be stated to disclose the hidden motives. It was recited therein that Chappell had procured from Beshoar and others an option on a controlling interest in the stock of the Grey Creek Company, and he undertook to obtain from that company a lease of the estate for a term of twenty years on sundry conditions. The only one of importance is that which looked to the expenditure of money for the development of the property. The Colorado Coal and Iron Company undertook to spend sixty thousand dollars for this purpose. It will be observed there was a very strange coincidence between the amount which The C. C. & I. Co. agreed to spend and the sum for which Chappell undertook to sell the Grey Creek Company’s stock. The evidence likewise disclosed that as fast as money was disbursed by him as an officer of the Grey Creek Company in payment of the bills which were incurred in the development, these vouchers were turned over to the manager of The C. C. & I. Co., who honored them by checks of that corporation for their face value. It thus resulted that what Chappell paid out with bis right hand for the Grey Creek Company he instantly got back in his left from The C. C. & I. Co. On the 27th of September, which was the day following the execution of the agreement between Chappell and The C. C. & I. Co., the Grey Creek Company and The C. C. & I. Co. made an agreement of a lease which contained the provisions and various conditions specified in the agreement bet ween. Chappell and *327that corporation. It was executed by the lessors, through Chappell, the vice president, and by the proper officers on behalf of The C. C. & I. Co. Under the provisions of this lease, The C. C. & I. Co. spent sixty thousand dollars, opened up the property, paid royalties from time to time, but in the end suspended operations. The transaction concerning this stock is not creditable to the appellee, Chappell, and we cannot close our mental vision to what is so evident from the record that the scheme was one cunningly devised for the appropriation without cost to.him of one half of the capital stock of the Grey Creek Company. This in no wise militates against what we said at the outset concerning the force of the court’s conclusion on matters of fact, because our.opinion in no wise affects the legal result which we have reached. We have simply given expression to our doubts respecting this matter, for, if the thing be possible, we desire to so far leave the matter open that the Grey Creek Company may ultimately be able to establish and enforce its rights. We have stated enough to show the alleged basis for the suits which Beshoar afterwards brought. Beshoar claims that for a long time he was ignorant of the situation, and without knowledge of what Chappell had done with reference to the disposition of the Grey Creek Company’s stock, and was uninformed concerning this contract between The C. C. & I. Co. and Chappell. There was a change in the management of The C. C. & I. Co., and in the investigations which followed it, this agreement between Chappell and the company came to the surface, and Beshoar learned of it. How little or how much he knew before of the transaction is not easily ascertained from the testimony. The record shows the lease to The C. C. & I. Co. was made in February, 1.888, and shortly thereafter that company went into possession of the property, and engaged in its development. Beshoar knew of the lease, and had frequent conferences with Chappell concerning its terms. Whether he had any other information which should have advised him concerning the exact nature of the transaction is not apparent. *328He was not told of this contract between Chappell and The C. C. & I. Co., nor did he learn of it until about the middle of 1890, when he was fully advised concerning its existence and its terms. After the resurrection of this agreement, Beshoar and The C. C. & I. Co. made an arrangement to start a litigation to hold Chappell responsible for what he had done, and establish Beshoar’s rights as a stockholder, for the benefit both of Beshoar and The C. C. & I. Co. The arrangement which was made provided substantially for the advancement to Beshoar of six thousand dollars, or, at all events, he was in some way to receive that amount of money, and The C. C. & I. Co. undertook the prosecution of such suits as might be necessary to establish Beshoar’s rights. The C. C. & I. Co. were to pay all costs, furnish an attorney, and, in general, maintain the prosecution. Thereupon, three suits were begun. The first we will call “ 3209,” the second “ 3362,” which are cases by Beshoar against divers defendants, and the third “3218,” which is the Grey Creek Company against Beshoar and MacKenzie. We will only state enough of the purposes of these actions,to illustrate their scope and the object of the pleader. In the first, Beshoar charged that Chappell had sold one thousand shares of stock and appropriated the proceeds to his own use ; further, that he had issued other stock and disposed of it, appropriating the results of the sales. In “ 3362,” Beshoar charged that all the stock which had been issued, other than that which had come to him, had been issued without any consideration whatever, and was fraudulent and void in the holder’s hands, and he sought to have it cancelled, thereby increasing the value of his own holdings. In “ 3218,” the Grey Creek Company charged that some certificates of stock had been irregularly issued, and had illegally come into the possession of Beshoar, and his refusal to surrender them for cancellation. The company prayed a decree that Beshoar be compelled to surrender them for destruction. All these three suits were ultimately consolidated and tried as one case. There was no rule compelling the parties to replead, nor *329were the issues in the several suits in any wise changed by the order. Nothing farther need be stated concerning the object of the suits, or the general averments of the various pleadings. This much further must be stated, because it is of great gravity and importance in forcing the result. It will be observed nothing has been said concerning any statement in the pleadings as to the reason why the suit was brought by Beshoar, and why it was not brought by the Grey Creek Company against Chappell. It is very evident, as a general proposition, that if Chappell had sold the stock of the company while acting as an officer or director of it, or had appropriated the proceeds of it while acting in any such capacity, he would be liable to answer to the company for whatever he might have received. It is equally true, if he had issued the stock without consideration, and the stock had ultimately come back into his possession, the company would have had the legal right to compel its surrender and cancellation on making out a proper case. Beshoar was a stockholder, and, to the extent of his holding, interested in the affairs, management and prosperity of the new company. His rights as a stockholder need not be here discussed, but they are referred to in this manner to emphasize the omission in his pleading. There is nothing in either of the complaints which he filed showing a demand on the officers of the Grey Creek Company with reference to the enforcement of the corporate rights, nor did he, as plaintiff, allege, in either one of the suits, anything which might operate by way of excuse for the omission of this request. There is nothing to show an attempt to secure action by the officers or board of directors of the company, or concurrent action with the other Stockholders to compel those people to proceed. The twenty-first finding of fact is very specific and direct on this point. It likewise demonstrates that the directors of the Grey Creek Company, other than Chappell, were in no manner connected with the contract which Chappell had made with The C. C. & I. Co., and were perfectly free to act as they might be advised for the protection of the stockholders of the corporation *330■which they represented. We quite concur with the court in its conclusion that the evidence does not show any such condition of affairs respecting the management and directory of the Grey Creek Company as tends to excuse the stockholder from preferring a request for corporate action. What has been stated suggests the only two propositions which we deem it essential to discuss or decide. The first respects the interest in which the litigation is being prosecuted, and the second is the failure of the plaintiff to either plead or prove a cause of action on his behalf as a stockholder. If this litigation had been honestly instituted by a stockholder for the protection of his and other stockholders’ rights, and was not so evidently a suit instigated by a rival company for its own interests, we should strive to be astute to discover some remedy for a very evident wrong. The far reaching and flexible nature of equitable powers might, with proper proof and under other circumstances, enable us to do justice as between the stockholders of the Grey Creek Company and Chappell, its officer and director. But we have no inclination to struggle for this result, because it is a well settled principle that whenever it is made to appear that the suit was .not begun in good faith by a shareholder for the protection of his rights, but was in reality originated and prosecuted by another corporation for its own benefit, the court will consider what led the plaintiff to institute his suit, and, finding some other reason than a desire to protect stockholders’ rights, will refuse to entertain the bill. Forrest v. Manchester, etc., R'way Co., 4 De G., F. & J. 19 (65 Eng. Chan., 125); Filder v. London, etc., R'way Co., 1 H. & M. 489; Belmont v. Erie R'way Co. et al., 52 Barb. 637; Waterbury v. The Merchants’ Union Express Co., 50 Barb. 157; Camblos v. The P. & R. R. R. Co., 4 Brewster, 563. Naturally, the cases respecting this proposition are limited, since the question could not often arise. It seldom happens that shareholders, otherwise than for the protection of their own interests, come into courts of equity to seek redress for wrongs done the corporation of which they are *331members. But wherever it is apparent that this has been done, the courts have never hesitated to send the plaintiff out of court and refuse him relief.

It is too late now to insist that a stockholder as such is never without the right *332to file a bill for the protection of his interests, or even for the redress of what may be termed a corporate wrong. In the increasing diversity of corporate organizations, it not infrequently happens that the control and management of their affairs fall into the hands of unscrupulous persons, who do not hesitate to use the corporate powers to their personal advantage, and to the destruction of the rights of co-stockholders. This increasing danger and difficulty has often led to the institution of suits for the protection of stockholders. The powers of a court, of equity are not often vainly sought to redress a manifest injury where the corporate authorities have refused to proceed. This is no infraction of the general rule that corporations must act by properly constituted authority and organization, and by corporate methods and in corporate ways. The necessity of effort to procure such action has been settled by a series of well considered cases.

Tested by this rale, none of the suits brought by Beshoar can be maintained. His pleadings are totally wanting in all averments, either of request or of excuse, and, being bills on behalf of a stockholder to redress a corporate injury, they do not state a cause of action. We might be inclined to disregard this defect if the case as he made it contained the elements of an excuse for his failure. None was proven and none exists. The court very properly found that none of the other directors or officers of the Grey Creek Company were concerned in the contract which Chappell made with the C. C. & I. corporation, or had anything whatever to do with reference to those acts which Beshoar charges were a *333fraud on the Grey Creek Company. It was found that Beshoar made no request of the Grey Creek officers or directors to institute a suit against Chappell to compel him either to account for the stock or the money which he had received from the sale of it. As Chappell was the onty person concerned in the diversion of the funds or in the appropriation of the stock, we cannot presume that the Grey Creek Company as a corporation, would have failed on request to institute the proper suit for the enforcement of the corporate rights. It was Beshoar’s duty to show that he had exerted all means within his power to obtain by corporate action the redress of his grievances. The court must be satisfied that all honest and reasonable efforts were resorted to to the accomplishment of that end. Failing in this, he will not be permitted to maintain his suit. There is nothing in the present case which brings the plaintiff within the rule, and there is no testimony in the record which permits us to assert for his benefit what, under other circumstances, might prove operative as an excuse. The suit was,not honestly instituted by Beshoar for his own benefit, and he was without capacity to maintain it. The judgment as to him must be affirmed.

8340141_1,2213,"White, J. I dissent from the judgment of the court in this case. In regard to the statement accompanying the opinion, I will merely say that I do not assent to it as containing a full presentation of the circumstances of the case. I do not propose, however, to enter into a general review of the case, but to state briefly the grounds of my dissent. * 614The case has already been before the court on error, and is found reported in 20 Ohio St. 517. The will was also brought before the court for consideration in the case of Davis et al. v. Boggs et al., Id. 550. In these cases the will is, in substance, set out., Three tracts of land were disposed of by the will, besides the lands in controversy in this case. One of them being described as the farm on which the testator formerly resided. In regard to the present ease, I will say, in the first place, it is very questionable whether a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs below ought, upon any aspect of the testimony, to be sustained, even if the charge of the court to the jury were unobjectionable. But it seems ' quite plain to me that the charge was calculated to mislead the jury, and that the verdict Óf the jury is attributable to the misleading nature of the charge. And this is especially true in view of the character of the evidence before the jury. At the time of making his will, in 1842, the testator owned a body of land consisting of about 490 acres, on which he resided. From about the year 1833, this body of land was farmed as one farm. It was divided into various fields ; but for some years prior to the making of the will there was nothing on the land or in the mode of its cultivation indicating that the body of land consisted of two farms. Testimony was admitted by the court against the objections of the defendants of various declarations of the testator, made before and after the making of the will, in regard to the lands in question, and which were admitted and allowed to be used by the jury to show what the testator meant to devise by the following clause of his will, viz : “ I give and bequeath unto my beloved wife the whole of my home farm, where I now reside, as an estate in fee simple. ” That is, whether he meant to devise the whole tract, or only about 150 acres off the south end of the tract. The general character of this evidence is illustrated by the following extract from the testimony of Mrs. Grondo Taylor, taken from the bill of exceptions, viz : * 615 “ Ques. Mrs. Taylor, do yon know of any division of that property while you lived there? “ Ans. I heard uncle ( Capt. Taylor ) tell just where the line was. - “ Ques. The line of what? “ Ans. Between the Joe Boyd and the home place. “ Ques. What did you hear Capt. Taylor say, and to whom? “ Ans. I heard him tell aunt ( Mrs. Jane Taylor ) just where the line was between the two places — the Joe Boyd place and the home place. “ Ques. What did he say to her? “ Ans. He told her that the line went along the south line of the Pelham lot down across the corner of the meadow, and between where the machine - house stood, where they thrashed their grain, and the brick - kiln ; from that to the river. “ Ques. When was it you heard him tell that? “ Ans. I think it was the summer before he died ; the fore part of the summer. He told her where the line was at the other side of the place too. ” The line referred to by this witness, as described by Capt. Taylor, constituted, as the plaintiffs below claimed, the north boundary of his “ home farm. ” The lands north of that line they sought to recover in this action, as not being part of the “ home farm ” devised to the widow, and which they claimed as residuary devisees under the will. Under this state of the evidence, the court instructed the jury, among other things, as follows : “ You will look to all the evidence admitted by the court, and determine what the testator meant by his home farm at the time he made his will — what it is that corresponds with that description. “ What lands did he mean when he used the words ‘ the whole of my home farm where I now reside? ’ When he used these words he evidently supposed they were sufficiently definite in meaning to enable all parties concerned to determine what land he intended to give his wife. * 616 “ In this action the plaintiffs must recover, if they recover at all, by satisfying you by a preponderance of proof that they have title to the lands claimed by them, or some definite and ascertained part thereof. Keeping, then, this rule in your mind, and applying it to the evidence, ascertain what parcel of land did Captain James Taylor intend to pass to his wife when he devised to her his home farm ; that farm she would take under the will, and the plaintiffs will take his other lands, if any remain, described in the petition. “ If the plaintiffs, by their proof, have convinced you that at any time after Captain Taylor topic back the lands from Boyds he regarded such lands as two distinct farms ; if they were two distinct farms in his mind, with a definite boundary between them, and so treated and used by him, one of tohich he regarded and in his mind was his home farm, and was so denominated by him, the presumption is that he continued so to regard it, and you must so find, unless the proof shows you that he afterward changed his mind and manner of treating it, and afterward considered, designated and treated it as one farm. ” It is manifest from these instructions, that the declarations of the testator were not merely to be used by the jury as bearing upon the question whether the whole body of land constituted in fact two farms, or but one ; but as direct evidence to show the testator ’ s intention. So that, if the jury found that there was in fact but a single farm, yet if they found, from the declarations of the testator, that he regarded the lands in his mind as two farms, the j ury were to so regard it, without reference to what the fact might be. What the testator meant is to be ascertained by the language contained in the will. “ The question, in expounding a will, is, not what the testator actually intended as contradistinguished from what his words express, but what is the meaning of the words he has used. ” The words of a will are to be understood in their strict and primary meaning, unless it appears from the context they are used in a different sense. Where there is nothing in the context showing the words to be used in any other * 617than their strict and primary sense, and the words as so understood are sensible with reference to extrinsic circumstances, it is laid down by Wigram as an inflexible rule of construction that the words are to be interpreted in that sense and in no other, although they may be capable of some secondary interpretation, and although the most conclusive evidence of intention to use them in such secondary sense be tendered. The language of the will is, of course, to be read in the light of the state of things existing at the time the will was made and to which it relates. This state of things is provable by parol evidence, and constitutes the extrinsic facts in the light of which the will is to be construed and applied. The parol evidence must be pertinent and material to the fact to be established, and should be limited to the purposes for which it is introduced. In the present case, the testator admittedly had but one home farm, and the question in controversy was as to the extent of that farm. The defendants claimed that the farm consisted of the entire 490 acres ; while the claim of the plaintiffs was that the whole body of land constituted two farms. Any evidence tending to show whether the entire body of land constituted in fact two farms or only one, was pertinent and material. Whether there were two farms or only one, was a question of fact to be determined upon the evidence. But if, in view of all the evidence, the whole body of land constituted in fact a single farm, it could not be made two, by showing by parol testimony that the testator so intended, or so regarded it in Ms mind. A devise of a particular farm or parcel of land can not be defeated by showing by parol that it was the intention of the testator to devise but part of it. Under the ambiguous nature of the charge, the jury were allowed to resort to parol evidence as a direct means of ascertaining the meauing and intention of the testator. The intent and meaning as thus ascertained, they were, in effect, told to regard as the meaning of the will. This was putting the oral testimony. on an equal footing with the lan * 618guage of the will, as a means of ascertaining the intention of the testator. The dangerous character of such evidence is manifest in this case. The declarations of the testator occurred more than thirty years before the witnesses were called on to testify concerning them, and when, in the nature of things, many of the circumstances attending the making of the declarations and explanatory of them would be forgotten. And yet these declarations were submitted to the jury as evidence of the intention of the testator, to control what would ' otherwise be the plain meaning and operation of the will as applied to the subject of the devise. No where in the charge was it submitted to the jury to determine, as a question of fact, whether the whole body of land constituted one farm or two farms ; but they were directed to ascertain how it was regarded in the mind of the testator, without reference to how it was in fact. In my view, the way in which the case was tried was an indirect, though an effectual mode of subverting the policy of the law which requires wills to be made in writing, and tbat, for this reason, the judgment should be reversed. Rex, J., concurred in the dissenting opinion.",8340141," White, J. I dissent from the judgment of the court in this case. In regard to the statement accompanying the opinion, I will merely say that I do not assent to it as containing a full presentation of the circumstances of the case. I do not propose, however, to enter into a general review of the case, but to state briefly the grounds of my dissent. *614The case has already been before the court on error, and is found reported in 20 Ohio St. 517. The will was also brought before the court for consideration in the case of Davis et al. v. Boggs et al., Id. 550. In these cases the will is, in substance, set out., Three tracts of land were disposed of by the will, besides the lands in controversy in this case. One of them being described as the farm on which the testator formerly resided. In regard to the present ease, I will say, in the first place, it is very questionable whether a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs below ought, upon any aspect of the testimony, to be sustained, even if the charge of the court to the jury were unobjectionable. But it seems' quite plain to me that the charge was calculated to mislead the jury, and that the verdict Óf the jury is attributable to the misleading nature of the charge. And this is especially true in view of the character of the evidence before the jury. At the time of making his will, in 1842, the testator owned a body of land consisting of about 490 acres, on which he resided. From about the year 1833, this body of land was farmed as one farm. It was divided into various fields; but for some years prior to the making of the will there was nothing on the land or in the mode of its cultivation indicating that the body of land consisted of two farms. Testimony was admitted by the court against the objections of the defendants of various declarations of the testator, made before and after the making of the will, in regard to the lands in question, and which were admitted and allowed to be used by the jury to show what the testator meant to devise by the following clause of his will, viz : “ I give and bequeath unto my beloved wife the whole of my home farm, where I now reside, as an estate in fee simple.” That is, whether he meant to devise the whole tract, or only about 150 acres off the south end of the tract. The general character of this evidence is illustrated by the following extract from the testimony of Mrs. Grondo Taylor, taken from the bill of exceptions, viz : *615“ Ques. Mrs. Taylor, do yon know of any division of that property while you lived there ? “ Ans. I heard uncle (Capt. Taylor) tell just where the line was. - “ Ques. The line of what ? “ Ans. Between the Joe Boyd and the home place. “ Ques. What did you hear Capt. Taylor say, and to whom? “Ans. I heard him tell aunt (Mrs. Jane Taylor) just where the line was between the two places—the Joe Boyd place and the home place. “ Ques. What did he say to her ? “ Ans. He told her that the line went along the south line of the Pelham lot down across the corner of the meadow, and between where the machine-house stood, where they thrashed their grain, and the brick-kiln ; from that to the river. “ Ques. When was it you heard him tell that ? “ Ans. I think it was the summer before he died ; the fore part of the summer. He told her where the line was at the other side of the place too.” The line referred to by this witness, as described by Capt. Taylor, constituted, as the plaintiffs below claimed, the north boundary of his “ home farm.” The lands north of that line they sought to recover in this action, as not being part of the “ home farm ” devised to the widow, and which they claimed as residuary devisees under the will. Under this state of the evidence, the court instructed the jury, among other things, as follows : “ You will look to all the evidence admitted by the court, and determine what the testator meant by his home farm at the time he made his will—what it is that corresponds with that description. “ What lands did he mean when he used the words ‘ the whole of my home farm where I now reside ?’ When he used these words he evidently supposed they were sufficiently definite in meaning to enable all parties concerned to determine what land he intended to give his wife. *616“ In this action the plaintiffs must recover, if they recover at all, by satisfying you by a preponderance of proof that they have title to the lands claimed by them, or some definite and ascertained part thereof. Keeping, then, this rule in your mind, and applying it to the evidence, ascertain what parcel of land did Captain James Taylor intend to pass to his wife when he devised to her his home farm; that farm she would take under the will, and the plaintiffs will take his other lands, if any remain, described in the petition. “ If the plaintiffs, by their proof, have convinced you that at any time after Captain Taylor topic back the lands from Boyds he regarded such lands as two distinct farms; if they were two distinct farms in his mind, with a definite boundary between them, and so treated and used by him, one of tohich he regarded and in his mind was his home farm, and was so denominated by him, the presumption is that he continued so to regard it, and you must so find, unless the proof shows you that he afterward changed his mind and manner of treating it, and afterward considered, designated and treated it as one farm.” It is manifest from these instructions, that the declarations of the testator were not merely to be used by the jury as bearing upon the question whether the whole body of land constituted in fact two farms, or but one; but as direct evidence to show the testator’s intention. So that, if the jury found that there was in fact but a single farm, yet if they found, from the declarations of the testator, that he regarded the lands in his mind as two farms, the j ury were to so regard it, without reference to what the fact might be.

6086760_1,2203,"Rose, J. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court ( Malone, Jr., J. ), entered June 13, 2001 in Albany County, which partially granted petitioner ’ s application, in a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78, to review a determination of the Department of Health reducing a component of its Medicaid reimbursement rate. Petitioner, a residential health care facility operating in Chemung County, commenced this proceeding seeking, inter alia, annulment of respondents ’ determination adjusting its case mix index based on misclassifications revealed in an audit of patient review instrument data conducted by the Department of Health ( hereinafter Department ) and recalculating petitioner ’ s Medicaid reimbursement rate for the period beginning April 1, 1999. 1 Specifically, the Department found that petitioner had improperly classified 28 patients as receiving restorative therapy rather than maintenance therapy, reduced petitioner ’ s reimbursement rate accordingly, and directed that future patient assessments be performed by an independent auditor. Petitioner argued that the Department ’ s nurse - auditors had improperly “ second - guessed ” the physician - prescribed rehabilitative care plans for its patients by denying reimbursement even though petitioner had provided restorative therapy as prescribed. Petitioner also argued that the Department acted arbitrarily and capriciously in using a fixed general rule precluding reimbursement for restorative therapy unless it produces actual improvement ( hereinafter actual improvement standard ) that has not been properly adopted and filed as a formal regulation. Supreme Court accepted this latter argument, granted the petition and remitted the matter to respondents to review the patient classifications without re * 773course to the actual improvement standard. Respondents now appeal. 2 Respondents argue that Supreme Court ’ s ruling was improper because the Department ’ s actual improvement standard is based on a rational interpretation of an existing regulation and, thus, is not an unfiled rule. Petitioner reiterates its contentions that the denial of reimbursement for restorative therapy provided to its patients was improper both because it was based on an auditor ’ s after - the - fact medical judgment and on an unfiled rule requiring actual improvement. Since the Department ’ s auditors were not required to defer to the judgments of petitioner ’ s physicians and therapists in retrospectively reviewing what patient care qualified for Medicaid reimbursement ( see, Concourse Rehabilitation & Nursing Ctr. v DeBuono, US Dist Ct, SD NY, June 11, 1988, Conti, J., slip op at 12, appeal dismissed 179 F3d 38 ), we find no merit in petitioner ’ s first contention. Rather, as considered by Supreme Court and as presented on appeal, the central issue is whether respondents ’ actual improvement standard for the restorative therapy classification is a rational interpretation of an existing regulation or a new unfiled rule being applied in violation of the State Administrative Procedure Act. Under 10 NYCRR 86 - 2. 30 ( i ) ( Instructions : Patient Review Instrument [ PRI ] [ 27 ] ), a restorative therapy classification is proper where “ [ t ] here is positive potential for improved functional status within a short and predictable period of time ” and the “ [ t ] herapy plan of care and progress notes * * * support that [ the ] patient has this potential / is improving. ” In its clarification sheet provided to nursing homes, the Department explains that the phrase “ has this potential / is improving ” means that the patient must demonstrate both the potential for functional improvement and the actual occurrence of such improvement in order to qualify for the restorative therapy classification. On this appeal, the Department acknowledges that it has a fixed policy of applying the quoted regulation in this manner. Contrary to Supreme Court ’ s conclusion, we find that the Department ’ s clarification sheet is interpretive, that its interpretation has a rational basis and that, therefore, the resulting actual improvement standard does not constitute an improper unfiled rule ( see, State Administrative Procedure Act * 774 § 102 [ 2 ] [ b ] [ iv ] ; see also, Matter of Dubb Enters. v New York State Liq. Auth., 187 AD2d 831, 833 ; cf, Matter of Cordero v Corbisiero, 80 NY2d 771, 772 - 773 ; Matter of Stuyvesant Polyclinic v Axelrod, 117 AD2d 99, 101 ). Generally, “ courts will defer to an agency ’ s interpretation of its own regulations if not irrational ” ( Matter of Silver Lake Nursing Home v Axelrod, 156 AD2d 789, 790 ; see, Matter of Marzec v DeBuono, 95 NY2d 262, 266 ; Matter of County of Rockland v Axelrod, 157 AD2d 960, 961 ), and the agency ’ s interpretation is not rendered irrational simply because the regulation may be susceptible to a different rational interpretation ( Matter of Jennings v New York State Off. of Mental Health, 90 NY2d 227, 239 ). Petitioner focuses on the role played by the forward slash or virgule in the phrase “ patient has this potential / is improving. ” Arguing that common usage reflects that the virgule merely means “ or, ” petitioner concludes that the Department ’ s requirements of potential improvement and actual improvement contradicts the language of the regulation. Our view of the use of the virgule in the regulation at issue here leads to a contrary conclusion. “ Virgule ” has been defined as a symbol used to denote, inter alia, “ or ” or “ and or ” ( see, Webster ’ s Third New International Dictionary 2555 [ unabridged 1986 ], cross - referencing “ diagonal, ” Webster ’ s Third New International Dictionary 622 [ unabridged 1986 ] ). Even defined in this way, the virgule allows for usage as “ and, ” resulting in no contradiction when both alternatives apply. However, “ virgule ” is more comprehensively defined as “ a short oblique stroke ( / ) between two words indicating that whichever is appropriate may be chosen to complete the sense of the text in which they occur ” ( Random House Dictionary of the English Language 2125 [ unabridged 2d ed 1993 ] ). This definition is particularly apt here because the phrase “ patient has this potential / is improving ” follows, and is parallel to, the preceding phrase “ therapy plan of care and progress notes. ” To interpret the entire regulation, rather than parse the latter phrase only, it is rational to view the virgule as indicating that the reader should use the words that most appropriately complete the sense of the whole sentence. As the earlier phrase has two concepts with one anticipating future progress and the other reporting actual progress, the phrase “ patient has this potential / is improving ” provides the choice between potential and actual circumstances depending upon whether a plan for a patient or a patient ’ s progress is being considered. Interpreted this way, the regulation requires a therapy plan to set forth the patient ’ s potential for improvement and the patient ’ s prog * 775ress notes to reflect actual improvement in order to qualify as restorative. Such an interpretation is also consistent with the overall regulatory scheme, for it seeks to assure that restorative therapy is utilized when it potentially will result in patient improvement while excluding reimbursement if the expected improvement is not achieved ( see, Concourse Rehabilitation & Nursing Ctr. v Whalen, 249 F3d 136, 143 - 146 ). 3 Given the parallel structure of the pertinent phrases of the regulation and the recognized use of the virgule to implement such parallelism, we find no conflict between the cited regulation and respondents ’ interpretation, and conclude that their interpretation has a rational basis. Finally, petitioner ’ s contention that the issue is not judicially reviewable because the Department, through its auditors, did not expressly rely on the actual improvement standard in reclassifying petitioner ’ s patients is belied by the petition itself, which narrowly framed the issue by asserting that the Department ’ s actual improvement standard had resulted in the reclassifications. Accordingly, it was error to grant the petition and require further assessment by the Department. Crew III, J. P., Peters, Mugglin and Lahtinen, JJ., concur.

Since the judgment issued by Supreme Court is nonimal and, thus, not appealable as of right ( see, CPLR 5701 [ b ] [ 1 ] ; [ c ] ), we exercise our authority to grant permission to appeal sua sponte given the importance of the issue presented ( see, Matter of Gane v Ambach, 135 AD2d 1013, 1013 - 1014 ). .

L. c. 89, § 8, ( the general “ right of way ” at intersections ) as well as G. L. c. 89, § 9 ( the duty of a motorist at an intersection governed by a stop sign ). We determine there was no error. The following evidence was adduced at trial. On January 9, 1996, the plaintiff was operating a motor vehicle on Revere Street a public way in Quincy. She testified that she came to a complete stop at a “ stop ” sign at the intersection of Revere Street and Mechanic Street also a public way. A large mound of snow obstructed her view and she was unable to see the intersection. She proceeded out into the intersection and stopped again about half way into the intersection. The passable roadway was narrowed considerably due to the snow banks on the sides of the road. She allowed a white car to pass her and then started up again. She testified that she saw the car operated by the defendant approaching at a speed of 45 miles per hour ; nevertheless she proceeded through the intersection, making a left turn in the path of the oncoming vehicle. The defendant ’ s vehicle struck the left side of the plaintiffs vehicle, with left hand side damage to the defendant ' s vehicle. The defendant testified that the plaintiff did not stop. The jury determined that the defendant was not negligent The court gave comprehensive instructions on the elements of negligence and the duty of care. The court specifically instructed the jury as to the issue of violation of a statute as evidence of negligence, taking pains to explain that the violation, if found, must be a contributing factor to the damage sustained by the plaintiff. See Minnehan v. Hiland, 278 Mass. 518, 523 ( 1932 ). He specifically charged as to the duty to stop at a stop sign as provided by G. L. c. 89, § 9. 2 The plaintiff ’ s quarrel with the judge is that he failed specifically to instruct as she requested regarding G. L. c. 89, § 8, the general duty of care applicable when two motorists arrive at an intersection at approximately the same time. There was no error. G. L. c. 89, § 8 expressly provides that its provisions do not * 138apply when an operator is otherwise directed by a traffic regulatory sign erected and maintained in accordance with the provision of Sec. 2 of Ch. 85 ( which would include “ stop ” signs ). See Canane v. Dandini, 355 Mass. 72, 75 ( 1968 ). G. L. c. 89, § 9 is the statute that is primarily applicable to intersections governed by stop signs. As stated in Canane, one directed to stop by a stop sign may not have the benefit of the general rule if the rule grants him the right of way, until he has complied with the order to stop. After stopping, the operator becomes subject to the general rule and may proceed and thereafter exercise the right of way in accordance with that rule. Id. at 75. However, the operator must proceed into the intersection with due care. Even if the operator has the right of way under c. 89, § 8, that right is subject to the requirement of using due care. Possession of the right of way is only one factor to be considered in deciding whether the operator has fulfilled his duty of due care. Id. at 76. Accordingly, an operator who has stopped at a “ stop ” sign may still be found to be negligent if he proceeds into the intersection without using due care. The duty to exercise due care requires an operator who has halted at a stop sign to behave with reasonable caution before entering the intersection. Even an operator who has stopped at a stop sign and has a “ right of way ” under § 8 may be found to be negligent if he proceeds into the intersection before he can do so with reasonable prudence and with suitable regard for his safety and that of others. Freyermuth v. Lutfy, 376 Mass., 612, 616, N. 3. ( 1978 ). Again, the “ right of way ^ rule in § 8 is not absolute, but is subject to the condition of due care as to its exercise. With these principles in mind, we turn to the judge ’ s charge. At the outset, we observe that it is not required that the judge charge the jury in the precise formulation proposed [ see Poole v. Boston & Main Ry., 216 Mass. 12, 15 ( 1913 ) ] so long as the judge fairly and adequately covers the point in the charge. See Comeau v. Beck, 319 Mass. 17, 10 ( 1946 ) ; Squires v. Fraska, 301 Mass. 474, 476 ( 1938 ). Stated somewhat differently, the denial of requested instruction does not constitute error where the requested instructions were covered substantially in the charge. Pearlin v. Farrell, 356 Mass. 741 ( 1970 ). The judge gave detailed and comprehensive instructions on the concept of negligence in the context of operating of motor vehicles. He explained the duty of a motorist with regard to intersections controlled by stop signs. This explanation included the duty to yield to vehicles in or in close proximity to the intersection. While the instruction did not follow precisely the formulation suggested in the Canane and Freyermuth cases, the judge ’ s instruction properly stressed the duty of due care when proceeding into the intersection governed by the stop sign after having stopped. Appeal dismissed. So ordered. “ Another rule of the road is that every driver approaching a stop sign, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, and if there is not a stop line, then [ at ] a point nearest the intersecting roadway before entering it After having stopped, the driver shall yield the right of way to every vehicle in the intersection or approaching in [ the ] other roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when the driver is moving across or within the intersection. ”",9294667," Welsh, J.

6228332_1,1038,"The opinion of this court was delivered by Coulter, J. The clerk to the commissioners is not forbidden by the law to be a purchaser of a tract of land sold at public sale by the commissioners for arrears of taxes. Hor is it so opposed to the policy of the law as to make it iniquitous and void. The sale is open to all, except the commissioners themselves, who are the vendors, and cannot therefore both sell and buy. The clerk is merely the scrivener or ministerial agent of the commissioners. He is, it is true, employed or appointed by the commissioners subject to their directions and instructions, and without any independent authority or control over such sales ; has no power in ordering, arresting, or continuing them, or in directing to whom the lands shall be stricken down. Everything he does in relation * 211to them must necessarily be in subservience to the directions of. the commissioners. And if he was the highest and best bidder at the sale, and the commissioners, who are sworn public officers, made him a deed in pursuance of the purchase, it is opposed by no statutory prohibition, or any rule of public policy that has been recognised by our courts. If the clerk of the commissioners had been the purchaser himself, and received a deed from the commissioners, and afterwards sold the land, he would undoubtedly be entitled to recover the purchase - money. But in this case he was not the purchaser himself, but interested to the extent of one moiety, in the tract purchased by Cash, the defendant. Cash and Miller Fox, who was the clerk, on the day of sale entered into a written agreement, that Cash should buy at the sale a tract, in the name of Curry, for their mutual and joint benefit, each to pay an equal proportion of the purchase - money and expenses. Cash made the purchase, and received a deed from the commissioners in 1834. Afterwards an ejectment was brought against Cash for the land, by the former owner, during the pendency of which, he called on Fox, by letter, to assist in conducting the suit. Before it was finally tried, Cash compromised and made a deed, himself and wife, to the agent of the plaintiff, in that suit, who was the former owner, on the 29th October, 1840. Some time before that, as alleged ( and there is no evidence to the contrary ), Fox, who had committed the management to Cash, left the neighbourhood, and did not know of the sale by Cash until shortly before this suit was brought on the 13th April, 1847. The court below was of opinion that the contract was executory, and against the policy of the law, and that, therefore, Fox could not recover his share of the purchase - money. But the contract was executed by the purchase at the commissioners ’ sale, and by the deed made to Cash in pursuance thereof. All that was against the policy of the law, even in the opinion of the court below, was fully executed and accomplished by the deed from the commissioners to Cash. From thenceforth Cash was the trustee of one moiety for Fox. For even if public policy made the purchase void, as against the county, or the former owner ; it would nevertheless be good as between Cash and Fox. It would be iniquitous to allow Cash to * 212pocket the whole proceeds, when Fox had paid half the consideration and expenses. In Lestapies v. Ingraham, 5 Barr, 81, the Chief Justice says, “ True it is that an illegal contract will not he executed, but when it has been executed by tbe parties themselves, and tbe illegal object of it has been accomplished, the money or thing which was the product of it may be a legal consideration among themselves for a promise, either express or implied ; and the court will not unravel the transaction to discover its origin. ” The case of Fackney v. Reynous, 4 Burr. 2069, cited by the Chief Justice in the above case, which was a bond given by one of two stockjobbers, for a difference in amount paid in a stock - jobbing transaction, prohibited by act of Parliament, is directly in point. It was held that tbe bond was good. But we are of opinion that there was nothing illegal or against tbe policy of tbe law in tbe transaction, and that Fox has a lawful and just claim against Cash for a moiety of the money he received for the land, together with interest. The statute of limitations is not a bar to the plaintiff ’ s action. Fox was not bound to know tbe precise time when Cash sold tbe land. It was tbe duty of Cash to give him notice. Cash was, in fact, the trustee, and Fox the cestui que trust of one moiety of the money for which the land was sold, and which is claimed in this action.

Sentence was fifty years ' imprisonment. The defendant presents five arguments for the reversal of his conviction. I Although the defendant argues that 11 percent of the veniremen had read newspaper accounts of the crime, there is absolutely no evidence of any actual prejudice against the defendant resulting from any pretrial publicity. The law on this subject is summarized as follows : "" Exposure of jurors to adverse publicity either prior to or during trial may create prejudice and violate a defendant ' s right to be tried by an impartial jury. The constitutional standard of jury impartiality does not require, however, that jurors be wholly ignorant of the facts and issues involved in the case. Thus, exposure does not impair the defendant ' s right to an impartial jury if the jurors can lay aside any impressions or opinions that result from pretrial media exposure and render a verdict based solely on evidence presented during the trial.... To establish impermissible juror partiality, the defendant must show that pretrial publicity resulted in either actual juror prejudice or pervasive community prejudice. "" Eleventh Annual Review of Criminal Procedure : United States Supreme Court And Courts of Appeal 1980 - 1981, 70 The Georgetown Law Journal 680 - 81 ( 1981 ) ( footnotes omitted ).

S. 282, 303, 97 S. Ct. 2290, 2303, 53 L. Ed. 2d 344 ( 1977 ). Since the defendant did not prove actual juror prejudice or attempt to show that the community was saturated with prejudicial articles, his motion for a change of venue on the basis of inflammatory and prejudicial pretrial publicity was properly denied.

The admission of these statements was also harmless where Sergeant Newell had already testified to their contents without objection. Allen v. State, 390 So. 2d 676 ( Ala. Cr. App. 1980 ). The statements only contained a brief statement of which photograph each witness selected and, after Sergeant Newell had related their contents to the jury, we fail to see how the admission of the written statements could have prejudiced the defendant. V After an examination of the record, we are not persuaded that the State failed to prove a proper chain of custody for the admission of fingerprints and related exhibits. To warrant the reception of an object in evidence against a proper objection, it is not necessary that the chain of custody be proved to an absolute certainty, but rather to a reasonable probability, that the object is the same as, and not substantially different from the object as it existed at the beginning of the chain.

The admission of these statements was also harmless where Sergeant Newell had already testified to their contents without objection. Allen v. State, 390 So. 2d 676 (Ala.Cr.App.1980). The statements only contained a brief statement of which photograph each witness selected and, after Sergeant Newell had related their contents to the jury, we fail to see how the admission of the written statements could have prejudiced the defendant. V After an examination of the record, we are not persuaded that the State failed to prove a proper chain of custody for the admission of fingerprints and related exhibits. To warrant the reception of an object in evidence against a proper objection, it is not necessary that the chain of custody be proved to an absolute certainty, but rather to a reasonable probability, that the object is the same as, and not substantially different from the object as it existed at the beginning of the chain.

6232199_1,1009,"The opinion of the court was delivered, by Read, J. The Twenty - fifth street culvert was constructed under the ordinances of the city of Philadelphia, of the 27th February and 1st October 1858, and 10th January 1859. It was built by contract, and the 5th and 6th sections of the first - named ordinance charged upon the properties in front of which * 11it passed, the sum of seventy - five cents for each lineal foot of the front of the said properties, the contractor to accept the sums so assessed and charged in part payment of his contract price, and to collect the same at his own cost ; and the better to enable him so to do, to use the name of the city of Philadelphia, and employ all legal remedies or proceedings, whether of lien or otherwise, to which the said city may be competent. The street on which this property is situate is Pennsylvania avenue, which has been laid over the old bed of the Union Canal, and is one hundred feet wide. The state used twenty - five feet of the line of the avenue for the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, which, by contract with the state, has passed into the hands of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company. Pennsylvania avenue has been laid out on a plan of the then district of Spring Garden, which has been confirmed but not opened through this lot, nor have any steps been taken for that purpose. The question upon this state of facts is, whether the 8th section of the Act of April 21st 1855, Digest of City Laws 5T, is applicable to this case. . Until opened, it is clearly not a street ( for if it is, it is one hundred feet wide ), but a piece of land marked out for a street, nearly twenty years ago, and under existing laws it cannot become one until damages are assessed and paid, or secured to be paid, according to law : Sower v. City of Philadelphia, 11 Casey 231 ; District of City of Pittsburgh, 2 W. & S. 320. By the 40th section of the Consolidation Act of 1854, it is enacted “ That it may be prescribed by ordinance that paving of streets, except at the intersections thereof, and of footways, and laying of water - pipes within the limits of the city, shall be done at the expense of the owners of the ground in front whereof such work shall be done, and liens may be filed by the said city for the same, as is now practised and allowed by law. ” This was conforming to the practice of the districts in such cases ; in the city proper it having been the rule to charge the paving of streets and laying of water - pipes upon the public funds of the corporation. The 8th section of the Act of 1855, after a provision authorizing the city to construct bridges to carry any street or highway across any ravine or stream therein, enacts that “ The charges for culverts and pipes shall be at not exceeding the following rates per lineal foot, according to the fronts of the owners, to wit, for water - pipes, seventy - five cents, making the usual allowance for corner lots ; for culverts ', seventy - five cents, and for street paving, one dollar per square yard, and all extra or further charge, and for intersections shall be paid out of the general taxation. ” * 12It is clear, from the previous legislation in relation to the districts, and the collocation of the various subjects in this section, that open streets only are contemplated in which ’ culverts are built, water - pipes laid, and paving done. This is also clearly the effect of the decision in The City of Philadelphia v. Tryon, 11 Casey 401, where the law on this subject is very fully and clearly stated by the present chief justice. It is not intended to limit the Act of February 18th 1769, 1 Smith ’ s L. 284, nor the powers vested in the city as a municipal corporation to construct culverts or common sewers through private property when necessary, a power which has been exercised by the old city in various instances ; nor is it intended to countenance the recovery back of sums which have been paid on the line of unopened streets. In cases like the present, it is within the power of the legislature to oblige the owners of property, similarly situated to the plaintiff, to pay their share of such expenses. In the present instance, this sewer was of vast importance to the citizens at large, and its object was to prevent the drainage of a large district passing into the Schuylkill above the dam, and thus preserving the purity of the water, upon which so much of the health of our city depends.

6230427_1,717,"The opinion of the court was delivered by Lewis, C. J. By the law of Pennsylvania a sale of personal property is not good as against the creditors of the vendor, unless possession be delivered to the vendor in accordance with the sale. When possession is retained by the vendor, it is not only evidence of fraud, but fraud per se. There are some exceptional cases. When from the nature of the transaction, possession either could not be delivered at all, or, at least without defeating fair and honest objects intended to be effected by, and which constituted the motive for entering into, the contract, the cause might be regarded as an exception to the rule. Where possession has been withheld from the vendee, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, some good reason for the arrangement beyond the convenience of the parties should appear : Clow et al. v. Woods, 5 S. & R. 273. But this rule does not appear to prevail in Virginia : Davis v. Turner, 4 Grattan 422. In that state the rule is, the retention of possession of personal property by the vendors, after an absolute sale, is prima facie fraudulent, but the presumption may be rebutted by proof. In this case the parties to the sale, and the property which was the subject of it, were within the jurisdiction of Virginia when the sale was made ; but the property, consisting of horses and mules, was subsequently sent over the state ' line into Pennsylvania to be pastured. The question is, whether on an attachment in Pennsylvania, by a creditor of the vendor, the validity of the sale shall be tested by the law of Virginia or by that of Pennsylvania.

The defendant seeks to set aside the amended complaint on the ground that it is for a cause of action different from that set forth in the original complaint, and therefore irregular. The original complaint alleged the construction of a rail road, across a bay between plaintiff ’ s farm and the Hudson River, and claimed damages for thus obstructing the navigation between the farm and the river. The amended complaint not only claims such damages for the injury already suffered by such obstruction, but also seeks indemnity for the future, by praying that the defendants be adjudged and enjoined to construct such a bridge as is required by the fifteenth section of their charter, so as to admit of the passage of plaintiff ’ s boats and vessels between his farm and the river. The original complaint claimed only legal relief. The amended complaint claims relief both legal and equitable ; and it is here contended by the defendant ’ s counsel that they can not both be united in the same action. The facts set forth in both the complaint and. the amended complaint are substantially the same. It is only in the relief prayed that they differ. We have certainly made but little progress in the reform that has been attempted, if law and equity can now only bp administered * 270in separate actions. If such is held to be the present rule of practice, the very object of having law and equity administered in the same tribunal and in the same forms of proceeding will be defeated. It was formerly considered a great evil that in a suit at law the plaintiff could be turned out of court, on the ground that his relief was in chancery ; and that where a bill was filed in the Court of Chancery, it might be dismissed, on the ground that the complainant had an ample remedy at law. The evil is still just as great as it was formerly, if a party can have only legal or equitable relief in the same action. In such case, if he commences his action asking for equitable relief, as for instance a specific performance, and it turns out that he is not entitled to it, but only to legal relief, by way of damages, he might perhaps, if such strictness is to govern, be put to a new action to obtain redress. This certainly ought not to be ; and such a strictness is hostile to the whole spirit of the change that has been made. In trying such a cause at the circuit, I should most certainly allow whatever amendment in the pleadings was necesssary to give the party redress. If the plaintiff had asked for equitable relief, and it turned out that he was entitled to legal relief only, I should permit him to take it in that form.

I see no objection in this case to uniting claims for both legal and equitable relief in the same action. Both depend on the same transaction and both are necessary to indemnify the plaintiff for past, and to protect him against future injury. I think the proper course, under our present system of practice, is to give the party whatever relief is applicable to the facts put * 271in issue in the pleadings and established on the trial, whether such relief be legal or equitable, or both. And I see no reason against uniting in one action claims for both legal and eqiutable relief, when they are not inconsistent with each other ( Linden agt. Hepburn, 5 How. Pr. R. 188 ). Substantial justice must no longer be sacrificed to mere form and technicality. It is said that different modes of trial are prescribed for legal and equitable issues. But they are not necessarily to be tried differently, for § 254 of the Code gives ample power to the court to direct that the latter class be tried before the same tribunal, which is prescribed by sections 252 and 253 for the former class.

7143310_1,5436,"Opinion of the Court by Judge Carroll. Affirming. - * 458This suit was brought by the - board of trustees of the Highland Park Graded Common School District against the members of the county board of health of Jefferson count ; and Dr. Whittenburg, the county health officer, for the purpose of enjoining them from enforcing an order directing vaccination by a day named in the order of all school children attending the graded school in question who had not been vaccinated within seven years preceding the issual of the order. After the issues had been made up, the case was submitted on the evidence and an agreed state of facts and the petition dismissed. Section 2049 of the Kentucky Statutes, which is a part of the chapter devoted to the powers and duties of the State Board of Health, provides, in part, that “ the board shall have general supervision of the health of the citizens of this State * * * and are further empowered to make and enforce rules and regulations to obstruct and prevent the introduction or spread of infectious or contagious diseases to or within the ' State. ” In section 2055 provision is made for the appointment of local boards of health for the respective counties in which they reside, and these county boards “ are authorized and shall have power to enforce the rules and regulations adopted by the State Board of Health. ” It further provides that “ such local boards are empowered and it shall be their duty to inaugurate and execute and to require the heads of families and other persons to execute such sanitary regulations as the local board may consider expedient to prevent the outbreak and spread of cholera, smallpox, yellow fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria and other epidemic and communicable diseases, and to this end may bring the infected population under prompt and proper treatment during premonitory or other - stages of the disease, and they are - empowered to go upon and inspect any premises which they may believe are in an unclean or infectious condition, and it shall be empowered to fix and determine the location of an eruptive hospital for the county, sufficiently remote from human habitation and public highways as in its. judgment is safe. ” And also directs that “ The local board shall appoint a competent practicing physician who shall be the health officer of the county and secretary of the board, whose duties shall be to see that the rules and regulations pro * 459vided for in this act, and the. rules - and regulations of the State Board of Health are enforced. ” In the chapter on smallpox, embracing sections 4. 608 - 4618, of the statutes, further provision is made for the prevention and spread of smallpox and the duty enjoined on. parents, guardians and other persons having the care, custody or control of children to have the same vaccinated. The graded school district here in question is located in Jefferson county, outside the corporate limits of the city of Louisville, and Dr. Whittenburg is the health officer for Jefferson county appointed by the local board of health of the county, which board in turn had been appointed by the State Board of Health. It further appears that the State Board of Health had adopted a regulation known as rule thirty - five reading : “ No person shall become a member of any public school within the jurisdiction of this board, as - teacher or scholar, without furnishing a certificate from some reputable physician that he or she has been successfully vaccinated, and has been re - vaccinated at least once every seven years. ’ ’ On January 10, 1916, Dr. Whittenburg, in his capacity as health officer for Jefferson county, and purporting to act by order of the Jefferson county board of health, served on each of the trustees of the graded school a notice in writing, which notice, after setting out rule thirty - five of the - State board, recited that “ information has come to this office - that the - rules - concerning vaccination in your school are not being carried out in accordance with the instructions of the board of health. * * * ‘ ‘ I expect each child enrolled to bring a certificate of successful vaccination, and file same with the teacher and principal in charge. You have - at present an infection of smallpox in your immediate school vicinity. * * * Vaccination must follow immediately, and certificates must be on file by the twentieth day of this month from all children who have not already complied with the - above instructions. In case of failure, they must be sent home. ’ ’ It appears, however, that Dr. Whittenburg issued this order or notice without having been expressly so directed to do by the county board or the State Board of Health ; and the trustees of the graded school refusing to obey the instructions contained in the notice, the county board of health, on February 4, 1916, held a meeting * 460and adopted a resolution reciting that “ it appearing that there are a number of smallpox cases in Highland Park and in the vicinity of the school houses in district No. 46, and that an epidemic is threatened in that neighborhood, and it further appearing that the board of trustees of the Highland Park Graded Common School District No. 46, and the principal of the school, wilfully refused to enforce rule No. 35 adopted by the State Board of Health ; * * • * now, therefore, it is ordered by the county board of health that the county health officer, Dr. Whittenburg, shall take all necessary steps by taking out warrants and instituting prosecutions against said parties, to the end that the vaccination laws nf the State of Kentucky and the rules and regulations of the State Board of Health be vigorously enforced and the lives of the school children and other residents of Jefferson county be protected. ” "" When this resolution was adopted by the county board of health Dr. Whittenburg again notified in writing - each of the school trustees to have all children attending school and not holding a certificate of successful vaccination, to be sent home and not allowed to re - enter without first showing a certificate of successful vaccination from some reputable physician. This notice further directed the trustees that it must be obeyed within twenty - four hours after its service. Aside from the stipulation of fact, in which it was agreed that there was a county board of health in Jefferson county composed of certain named persons, and that Dr. Whittenburg was the duly appointed health officer of the county, and that rule thirty - five had been adopted by the State Board of Health, the only evidence in the case consists of the deposition of Dr. Whittenburg. In his evidence he said, in substance, that he issued the notice of January tenth under what he conceived to be his authority as health officer of the county and without having been expressly directed to do so by either the State Board of Health or the county board of health. That when this notice was not obeyed, the county board of health had a meéting and adopted the resolution which was served on the trustees on February 4th. He further said that at the time of or before the issual of the notice in January, there was a child in the graded common school district who was afflicted with smallpox, and that subsequently several other cases of smallpox developed * 461at different places on the border line of this school district, although none of the persons ' afflicted lived in the. school district. ... Further testifying, he was asked and answered the following questions : “ Q. In your opinion, and from what you know of the situation out there, has the existence of those five cases of smallpox also caused a considerable exposure of other people to smallpox? A. Yes, I think so ; there can be no question about that. Then you can ’ t tell how far these exposures run. Q. Doctor, at the time you sent these communications about which you have testified, with reference to enforcing this rule thirty - five. of the State Board of Health, was or not the smallpox siiuation out there dangerous, or what was the nature of the situation? A. I considered it dangerous. On one occasion here we had one infection here in Louisville, a negro man, and I followed it thoroughly through, and tried to se, e if I could get in touch with where there were other cases around here, and I was unable to ; that I did in the State generally, and that winter we had 641 cases from that one negro man. I mention this to show how it will spread. where people are unvaccinated. Q. Does the presence of five cases of smallpox constitute an epidemic or create any danger of an epidemic breaking out? - A. Yes, there is no question about that. Q. Doctor, from your knowledge and experience as a physician, and especially your knowledge and experience with reference to this disease of smallpox, state whether or not vaccination is a prevention of smallpox? A. It is an absolute, positive preventive for seven years, and thereafter immunity may partially run om, and a mild form may occur later in life, the frequency of its occurring depending on the length oí time from vaccination, and I have never seen any one die that had been vaccinated at any time in life, even in infancy, from smallpox. It is the only known method of preventing the disease throughout the civilized world, the ' only preventive of the disease endorsed by all civilized countries on earth. Q. After a period of seven years has elapsed from vaccination, does or not the efficacy of it diminish? A. Yes, you lose a part of your immunity. In some cases you do not lose any. Q. Gan or not that immunity be regained by a fresh vaccination after seven years have elapsed? A. Yes, if you lose immunity, it is restored by re - vaccination, and a positive preventive again for the next lease - or the next length of * 462time. Q. Is it or not the generally accepted view of the medical profession that vaccination should he repeated after seven years have elapsed, at intervals of seven years? A. Yes, that is accepted by all reputable physicians. “ Q. Now, doctor, though a case of Smallpox is mild or may be mild, is it or not by reason of that fact any the less likely to give smallpox to other persons? A. No, I have seen them where they were in the very mildest form give it to others, of the most malignant type and die. I have seen that in my own experience. Q. Is the requirement of vaccination every seven years one which is necessary to prevent the spread of the disease? A. Yes, that is necessary to prevent the spread of it, and by following that system up we can get rid of it entirely. It is an absurd thing for a person to - have smallpox. Q. "" What is the opinion of the medical profession as to the efficacy of vaccination? A. The medical profession stands practically as a unit on that. I have had occasion to look at that carefully, and I have never found any reputable physician opposing vaccination. I have found some few physicians that were ignorant along medical lines opposing it, but found no reputable physician opposing vaccination. “ Q. Now, doctor, why would you state, as you have stated, that the presence of five cases of smallpox in the neighborhood of or adjacent to the Highland Park School District No. 46 constitutes an epidemic or imminent danger of an epidemic — why would you state that from your knowledge of the nature of the disease? A. All the epidemics that have spread here in. Louisville in the last fourteen years spread practically in the same manner ; a case brought in, you know, and people not properly vaccinated, and it spread just in that way. All epidemics spread just from one case ; That has been my experience for the last fourteen years. Q. State what is the nature of the disease with reference to the degree of contagiousness? A. It is highly contagious, one of the most highly contagious diseases I think known, to the medical profession. , Q. In your opinion did the smallpox situation in or near this school district at the time you took these steps that you have testified about, did the situation. at that time in your opinion require that this rule of the State Board of Health be enforced? A. Yes, sir. Q. Is that the situation at present? A. Yes. Q. If such rule * 463were not enforced would or not there be danger of a serious epidemic? A. Yes, in that vicinity. There are a good many people out there and children unvaccinated, and all the schools in the city and the rest of the county are vaccinated very thoroughly except in one of the most distant parts of the county. Q. In your experience how many people have you vaccinated? Between sixty and seventy thousand. Q. Have you ever known in your experience any of them to die that you vaccinated from vaccination? A. I never knew anybody to die form vaccination per se. Q. Is or not vaccination dangerous? A. No, there is not a possible chance for anybody to die, I didn ’ t think, from vaccination, unless they do not take the proper care of it. If there is any death at all, it will come from some infection like a scratch with a pin or something like that. A person can. die from a scratch from a pin causing blood poisoning, but from vaccination there is no chance for them to die. That has been my experience. Q. Is that the general experience of the profession? A. Yes, sir. ” On behalf of the school trustees the argument is made that Dr. Whittenburg, in his capacity as health officer for Jefferson county, was without power or authority to demand the observance of the notice issued by him on January 10, 1916, because he had not been expressly directed by either the State board or the county board to take the action set forth in this notice, and we may first dispose of this question. It will be noticed that under section 2055 of the statutes it is the duty of the health officer of the county “ to see that the rules and regulations of the State Board, of Health are enforced, ’ ’ and among the rules adopted by the State Board of Health was rule thirty - five heretofore set out, providing that no person shall become a, member of any public school without furnishing a certificate that he or she has been successfully vaccinated once every seven years ; and it is the contention of counsel for the local board of health that under authority of this rule and the power conferred by the statute, Dr. Whittenburg, as health officer, independent of any action on the part of the local board, had power to take the action set out in the notice of January 10th. The health officer of the county is primarily the agent and executive officer of the local board, and is charged with the duty of enforcing such rules and regulations as * 464the State board or the county board may adopt within the scope of the powers conferred upon them by the statute. - But we are not prepared to say that without express authority from either the State board or the county board the health officer would have power to take the responsible action assumed to be exercised in this notice of January 10th. It is quite a serious matter to order, as was done in this notice, that all of a great number of children attending a public school shall be vaccinated within a certain time or denied the privilege of attending school, and we are inclined to the view that before the health officer undertakes to demand the enforcement of a preventive regulation like this affecting so many people, he ought to have express authority so to do from either the State or the county board. We do not of course mean to hold that before the health officer can act in any case he must be armed with express authority from one of these boards, because many matters might come up in connection with the duties of his office that he should be permitted - to perform, in the exercise of a sound discretion and within the scope of his general authority, without having the express sanction of either the State or county board. And so we do not think it would be wise or prudent to attempt to describe in detail the things a health officer may 0£ may not do without the express direction of one of these boards. Sufficient for the purpose of this case is it, to say that in our opinion it would be investing the health officer with more authority than was contemplated by the statute if he should be given the power on his own volition to direct that all children attending one or more public schools should be promptly vaccinated or else denied the privilege of attending the school ; Taylor v. Adair County, 119 Ky. 374 ; Hickman County v. Scarborough, 150 Ky. 1. • • So far, however, as the questions arising in this case are concerned, it is not important whether Dr. Whittenburg did or did not have the authority attempted to be exercised at the time he gave the notice of January 10th because subsequent to this, and after having been expressly directed by the - county board so to do, he gave the notice of February 4th, and we may assume that the lower court, in dismissing the petition of the school trus : tees, considered that they were under a duty to enforce • compliance with this last notice. And. as this notice was * 465given by direct authority of the local board of health, the principal question in the case is, did the local board have power to direct the action set forth in this, notice to be taken? Counsel for the school board insist that neither the State board nor the county board of health had authority to adopt or enforce a regulation requiring the vaccination of school children as a condition precedent to their right to attend the public schools of the ‘ State. It is further contended in this behalf that there was not an epidemic or a threatened epidemic of smallpox in the Highland Park Graded School Dsitrict at the time of the issual of the order of February 4th. In disposing of these questions we will not stop to discuss the issue raised that vaccination is not a safe and valuable preventive for smallpox. There may be some difference of opinion as to its efficacy, but the weight of medical authority supports the view that it is not only a safe but a valuable preventive : Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11, 49 L. Ed. 643. Nor is it necessary to determine whether the action was taken under rule thirty - five of the State board or by the direction of the local board under the power vested in it. Each of these boards is charged independently with preserving the public health and with taking - such action as in the exercise of a reasonable discretion may be deemed necessary to suppress and prevent the spread of infectious, or contagious diseases. The only substantial difference in their powers, in respect to taking such measures as may be necessary to conserve the health of the people of the State is that the State board is invested by the statute with larger power and greater jurisdiction than the local boards. But the local boards may under the statute exercise the authority conferred! upon them without asking the advice or the consent of the State board. So that the adoption of rule thirty - five by the State board was. not necessary to confer upon the local board the power attempted to. be exercised, as set forth in this notice, if the conditions were such as to justify the county board in adopting this method of preventing and suppressing the spread of smallpox in the school district. We are further of the opinion that the language of the statute is broad enough to confer on the State board and the local boards, the authority to issue an order such * 466as the one here in question when they believe there is reasonable apprehension of an epidemic of smallpox in a school district and that the vaccination of the school children is the only means by which it can be prevented. It is true that the precise questions as to the power of these boards to make vaccination a condition precedent to attendance upon the public schools when there is a reasonable apprehension of an outbreak of smallpox and in the judgment and discretion of the board it is necessary to require the vaccination of school children, has not heretofore come before this court, but it has • frequently been adjudicated by other courts, and the uniform ruling is that when there is reasonable apprehension of the outbreak of a communicable disease such as smallpox, health boards have authority to take such action as was here directed : State v. Zimmerman, 86 Minn. 353 ; Blue v. Beach, 155 Ind. 121, 50 L. R. A. 64 ; Duffield v. Williamsport School District, 162 Pa. St. 476, 25 L. R. A. 152 ; Morris v. Columbus, 102 Ga. 792, 42 L. R. A. 175 ; State v. Hay, 126 N. C. 999, 49 L. R. A. 588 ; Bissell v. Davison, 65 Conn. 183, 29 L. R. A. 251 ; Viemeister v. White, 179 N. Y. 235, 70 L. R. A. 796 ; People v. Board of Education, 234, Ill. 422, 17 L. R. A. ( N. S. ) 709. And although we have no direct statutory direction on this subject, a reasonable ’ construction of the liberal powers ; conferred by the statute in the creation of these boards would imply a grant of authority to adopt in reference to public schools such measures as were ' here taken. Indeed, it would be extremely unfortunate if the legislature had limited the power of these boards in respect to dealing with situations such as this, or if the court should restrain them from taking such measures as might be by them deemed necessary to prevent an outbreak and epidemic of this disease in public schools, because there is scarcely any place where an outbreak of smallpox would spread with more rapidity or over a wider territory than if it found a starting place in one of the public schools attended by hundreds of children. . The argument is made that this construction gives to these boards great power. This is true, but necessarily so. The conditions which they were created to deal with could not be successfully met unless they had large power and discretion. In the very nature of things it would be utterly impracticable for the legislative department of the State to undertake to define the conditions that must * 467exist before these boards could take such action as might be necessary to control situations that are constantly coming up in various forms ; and so if these agencies of thq State created for the purpose of conserving the health of the people are to accomplish the objects for which they were created, they must need be given authority to take such prompt and effective action, in each case as it comes up, as in the exercise of their reasonable judgment and discretion may be deemed necessary to meet the exigencies of the occasion. They are not required to wait until an epidemic actually exists before taking action. Indeed, one of the chief purposes of their existence is to adopt and enforce such timely measures as will prevent epidemics. What they shall do and how it shall be done are matters left to their sound discretion. But of course these boards cannot adopt unreasonable or arbitrary rules or regulations or, without cause, harass the public or needlessly subject individuals to expense, or inconvenience or act unless they have reasonable grounds to believe that the action taken is necessary to prevent or suppress the disease sought to be controlled. And we have no doubt of the jurisdiction of the courts to restrain these boards if they should undertake to exert authority not fairly within the powers, conferred by the statute or plainly not needed for the purpose of conserving or protecting the health of the people or preventing the outbreak or spread of infectious or contagious diseases. These views are fully supported by the cases of Hengehold v. City of Covington, 108 Ky. 752 ; Trabue v. Todd County, 125 Ky. 809 ; Allison v. Cash, 143 Ky. 679 ; Hickman County v. Scarborough, 150 Ky. 1 ; Breckinridge County v. McDowell, 154 Ky. 721 ; Board of Health v. Kollman, 156 Ky. 351. Whether the State board or the local boards have authority to order vaccination of all children as a condition precedent to their attendance on school, in the absence of reasonable apprehension of an outbreak of this disease, is not before us in this case, and it is not necessary to a decision of this case that we should express an opinion on this subject. The remaining question is, did the facts, authorize the issual and the enforcement of the order adopted by the local board in respect to this graded school district? This may be shortly disposed of. Keeping in mind what we have said as to the power of the boards, and that the * 468discretion lodged in them will not be interfered with unless plainly abused, it is apparent from the evidence of Dr. Whittenburg supplemented by the action of the local board that there was a reasonable apprehension in the minds of the board that an epidemic - of smallpox might find a starting place ' in this school. And to prevent a calamity like this the board was authorized to take the action it did. The judgment is affirmed.",7143310," Opinion of the Court by Judge Carroll. Affirming.- *458This suit was brought by the- board of trustees of the Highland Park Graded Common School District against the members of the county board of health of Jefferson count; and Dr. Whittenburg, the county health officer, for the purpose of enjoining them from enforcing an order directing vaccination by a day named in the order of all school children attending the graded school in question who had not been vaccinated within seven years preceding the issual of the order. After the issues had been made up, the case was submitted on the evidence and an agreed state of facts and the petition dismissed. Section 2049 of the Kentucky Statutes, which is a part of the chapter devoted to the powers and duties of the State Board of Health, provides, in part, that “the board shall have general supervision of the health of the citizens of this State * * * and are further empowered to make and enforce rules and regulations to obstruct and prevent the introduction or spread of infectious or contagious diseases to or within the' State.” In section 2055 provision is made for the appointment of local boards of health for the respective counties in which they reside, and these county boards “are authorized and shall have power to enforce the rules and regulations adopted by the State Board of Health.” It further provides that “such local boards are empowered and it shall be their duty to inaugurate and execute and to require the heads of families and other persons to execute such sanitary regulations as the local board may consider expedient to prevent the outbreak and spread of cholera, smallpox, yellow fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria and other epidemic and communicable diseases, and to this end may bring the infected population under prompt and proper treatment during premonitory or other-stages of the disease, and they are- empowered to go upon and inspect any premises which they may believe are in an unclean or infectious condition, and it shall be empowered to fix and determine the location of an eruptive hospital for the county, sufficiently remote from human habitation and public highways as in its. judgment is safe.” And also directs that “The local board shall appoint a competent practicing physician who shall be the health officer of the county and secretary of the board, whose duties shall be to see that the rules and regulations pro*459vided for in this act, and the. rules- and regulations of the State Board of Health are enforced.” In the chapter on smallpox, embracing sections 4.608-4618, of the statutes, further provision is made for the prevention and spread of smallpox and the duty enjoined on .parents, guardians and other persons having the care, custody or control of children to have the same vaccinated. The graded school district here in question is located in Jefferson county, outside the corporate limits of the city of Louisville, and Dr. Whittenburg is the health officer for Jefferson county appointed by the local board of health of the county, which board in turn had been appointed by the State Board of Health. It further appears that the State Board of Health had adopted a regulation known as rule thirty-five reading: “No person shall become a member of any public school within the jurisdiction of this board, as-teacher or scholar, without furnishing a certificate from some reputable physician that he or she has been successfully vaccinated, and has been re-vaccinated at least once every seven years. ’ ’ On January 10,1916, Dr. Whittenburg, in his capacity as health officer for Jefferson county, and purporting to act by order of the Jefferson county board of health, served on each of the trustees of the graded school a notice in writing, which notice, after setting out rule thirty-five of the- State board, recited that “information has come to this office- that the- rules- concerning vaccination in your school are not being carried out in accordance with the instructions of the board of health. * * * ‘ ‘ I expect each child enrolled to bring a certificate of successful vaccination, and file same with the teacher and principal in charge. You have- at present an infection of smallpox in your immediate school vicinity. * * * Vaccination must follow immediately, and certificates must be on file by the twentieth day of this month from all children who have not already complied with the- above instructions. In case of failure, they must be sent home. ’ ’ It appears, however, that Dr. Whittenburg issued this order or notice without having been expressly so directed to do by the county board or the State Board of Health; and the trustees of the graded school refusing to obey the instructions contained in the notice, the county board of health, on February 4, 1916, held a meeting *460and adopted a resolution reciting that “it appearing that there are a number of smallpox cases in Highland Park and in the vicinity of the school houses in district No. 46, and that an epidemic is threatened in that neighborhood, and it further appearing that the board of trustees of the Highland Park Graded Common School District No. 46, and the principal of the school, wilfully refused to enforce rule No. 35 adopted by the State Board of Health; * * • * now, therefore, it is ordered by the county board of health that the county health officer, Dr. Whittenburg, shall take all necessary steps by taking out warrants and instituting prosecutions against said parties, to the end that the vaccination laws nf the State of Kentucky and the rules and regulations of the State Board of Health be vigorously enforced and the lives of the school children and other residents of Jefferson county be protected.” ""When this resolution was adopted by the county board of health Dr. Whittenburg again notified in writing-each of the school trustees to have all children attending school and not holding a certificate of successful vaccination, to be sent home and not allowed to re-enter without first showing a certificate of successful vaccination from some reputable physician. This notice further directed the trustees that it must be obeyed within twenty-four hours after its service. Aside from the stipulation of fact, in which it was agreed that there was a county board of health in Jefferson county composed of certain named persons, and that Dr. Whittenburg was the duly appointed health officer of the county, and that rule thirty-five had been adopted by the State Board of Health, the only evidence in the case consists of the deposition of Dr. Whittenburg. In his evidence he said, in substance, that he issued the notice of January tenth under what he conceived to be his authority as health officer of the county and without having been expressly directed to do so by either the State Board of Health or the county board of health. That when this notice was not obeyed, the county board of health had a meéting and adopted the resolution which was served on the trustees on February 4th. He further said that at the time of or before the issual of the notice in January, there was a child in the graded common school district who was afflicted with smallpox, and that subsequently several other cases of smallpox developed *461at different places on the border line of this school district, although none of the persons' afflicted lived in the .school district. ... Further testifying, he was asked and answered the following questions: “Q. In your opinion, and from what you know of the situation out there, has the existence of those five cases of smallpox also caused a considerable exposure of other people to smallpox? A. Yes, I think so; there can be no question about that. Then you can’t tell how far these exposures run. Q. Doctor, at the time you sent these communications about which you have testified, with reference to enforcing this rule thirty-five.of the State Board of Health, was or not the smallpox siiuation out there dangerous, or what was the nature of the situation? A. I considered it dangerous. On one occasion here we had one infection here in Louisville, a negro man, and I followed it thoroughly through, and tried to se,e if I could get in touch with where there were other cases around here, and I was unable to; that I did in the State generally, and that winter we had 641 cases from that one negro man. I mention this to show how it will spread . where people are unvaccinated. Q. Does the presence of five cases of smallpox constitute an epidemic or create any danger of an epidemic breaking out? - A. Yes, there is no question about that. Q. Doctor, from your knowledge and experience as a physician, and especially your knowledge and experience with reference to this disease of smallpox, state whether or not vaccination is a prevention of smallpox? A. It is an absolute, positive preventive for seven years, and thereafter immunity may partially run om, and a mild form may occur later in life, the frequency of its occurring depending on the length oí time from vaccination, and I have never seen any one die that had been vaccinated at any time in life, even in infancy, from smallpox. It is the only known method of preventing the disease throughout the civilized world, the' only preventive of the disease endorsed by all civilized countries on earth. Q. After a period of seven years has elapsed from vaccination, does or not the efficacy of it diminish? A. Yes, you lose a part of your immunity. In some cases you do not lose any. Q.

And although we have no direct statutory direction on this subject, a reasonable’ construction of the liberal powers; conferred by the statute in the creation of these boards would imply a grant of authority to adopt in reference to public schools such measures as were' here taken. Indeed, it would be extremely unfortunate if the legislature had limited the power of these boards in respect to dealing with situations such as this, or if the court should restrain them from taking such measures as might be by them deemed necessary to prevent an outbreak and epidemic of this disease in public schools, because there is scarcely any place where an outbreak of smallpox would spread with more rapidity or over a wider territory than if it found a starting place in one of the public schools attended by hundreds of children. .The argument is made that this construction gives to these boards great power. This is true, but necessarily so. The conditions which they were created to deal with could not be successfully met unless they had large power and discretion. In the very nature of things it would be utterly impracticable for the legislative department of the State to undertake to define the conditions that must *467exist before these boards could take such action as might be necessary to control situations that are constantly coming up in various forms; and so if these agencies of thq State created for the purpose of conserving the health of the people are to accomplish the objects for which they were created, they must need be given authority to take such prompt and effective action, in each case as it comes up, as in the exercise of their reasonable judgment and discretion may be deemed necessary to meet the exigencies of the occasion. They are not required to wait until an epidemic actually exists before taking action. Indeed, one of the chief purposes of their existence is to adopt and enforce such timely measures as will prevent epidemics. What they shall do and how it shall be done are matters left to their sound discretion. But of course these boards cannot adopt unreasonable or arbitrary rules or regulations or, without cause, harass the public or needlessly subject individuals to expense, or inconvenience or act unless they have reasonable grounds to believe that the action taken is necessary to prevent or suppress the disease sought to be controlled. And we have no doubt of the jurisdiction of the courts to restrain these boards if they should undertake to exert authority not fairly within the powers, conferred by the statute or plainly not needed for the purpose of conserving or protecting the health of the people or preventing the outbreak or spread of infectious or contagious diseases. These views are fully supported by the cases of Hengehold v. City of Covington, 108 Ky. 752; Trabue v. Todd County, 125 Ky. 809; Allison v. Cash, 143 Ky. 679; Hickman County v. Scarborough, 150 Ky. 1; Breckinridge County v. McDowell, 154 Ky. 721; Board of Health v. Kollman, 156 Ky. 351. Whether the State board or the local boards have authority to order vaccination of all children as a condition precedent to their attendance on school, in the absence of reasonable apprehension of an outbreak of this disease, is not before us in this case, and it is not necessary to a decision of this case that we should express an opinion on this subject. The remaining question is, did the facts, authorize the issual and the enforcement of the order adopted by the local board in respect to this graded school district? This may be shortly disposed of. Keeping in mind what we have said as to the power of the boards, and that the *468discretion lodged in them will not be interfered with unless plainly abused, it is apparent from the evidence of Dr. Whittenburg supplemented by the action of the local board that there was a reasonable apprehension in the minds of the board that an epidemic-of smallpox might find a starting place' in this school. And to prevent a calamity like this the board was authorized to take the action it did. The judgment is affirmed.

6021612_1,1705,"Carpinello, J. Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court ( Dawson, J. ), entered January 23, 1997 in Clinton County, which granted plaintiffs motion to dismiss the counterclaims of defendants Henry N. Dashnaw, Jr. and Kevin N. Dashnaw. In connection with their development of a “ planned unit development ” and golf course on property in the Town of Peru, Clinton County, defendants Henry N. Dashnaw, Jr. and Kevin N. Dashnaw ( hereinafter collectively referred to as defendants ), * 815sole partners of Northwood Estates, secured financing from plaintiff ’ s predecessor in interest in the amount of $ 300, 000. Defendants executed a “ mortgage note ” which was secured by a first mortgage on the real property. The note was subsequently modified on two occasions. After defendants defaulted on the loan, plaintiff commenced this foreclosure action in June 1995. On August 7, 1995, an amended answer was served with lender liability counterclaims asserting fraud, breach of good faith and fair dealing and breach of fiduciary duty, among other claims. The counterclaims sought, inter alia, “ a judgment reforming, as appropriate, the Notes and Obligations ” and damages. Two days after filing the amended answer, Northwood Estates filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US District Court in the Northern District of New York. It is undisputed that defendants ’ debt to plaintiff was scheduled as a partnership liability in the bankruptcy proceeding, that the counterclaims were scheduled as partnership assets ( see, 11 USC § 521 [ 1 ] ; see also, Bankruptcy Rules, rule 1007 [ g ] ) and that the instant action was stayed following defendants ’ successful procurement of a co - debtor stay ( see, 11 USC § 105 ). Notably, the bankruptcy plan of reorganization resolved the debt at issue in this action. Under the confirmed plan, defendants ’ mortgage loan was reinstated and modified. Defendants ’ refusal to voluntarily discontinue the instant State court action after plan confirmation forced plaintiff to move to dismiss the counterclaims based on the doctrine of res judicata. In a thorough and well - reasoned decision, Supreme Court granted plaintiff ’ s motion. “ Res judicata bars future litigation between the same parties, or those in privity with the parties, of a cause of action arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions as a cause of action that was either raised or could have been raised in a prior proceeding ” ( Matter of Joy Co. v Hudacs, 199 AD2d 858, 859 ). The doctrine applies with full force to Bankruptcy Court determinations ( see, e. g., McNeary v Senecal, 197 AD2d 835 ). Stated more simply, the doctrine of res judicata precludes second chance litigation and in our view that is exactly what defendants are attempting to gain in this case. Accordingly, we affirm. Even though defendants sought, and received, a co - debtor stay in the bankruptcy proceeding staying the instant foreclosure action and even though that proceeding restructured the very debt at issue herein, defendants maintain that their interests “ were simply not an issue in the Bankruptcy Proceeding ” and that the financial relationship between themselves * 816and plaintiff is “ wholly irrelevant to the financial relationships between Northwood Estates, as debtor, and [ plaintiff!, as creditor ”. We disagree and find that the lender liability counterclaims arose out of the same series of transactions as plaintiffs financial claims in the bankruptcy proceeding for the purpose of res judicata ( see generally, Eubanks v Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 977 F2d 166, 172 ). The crux of the counterclaims is that plaintiffs predecessor allegedly misrepresented that the note would be routinely renewed until paid in full. The bankruptcy proceeding, with the express consent of defendants, resulted in the loan being extended. Moreover, whether they agreed to the confirmed reorganization plan or not, defendants, as general partners in Northwood Estates, are now bound by it ( see, 11 USC § 1141 [ a ] ; see also, Sure - Snap Corp. v State St. Bank & Trust Co., 948 F2d 869, 873 [ res judicata bars any attempt by parties to reorganization hearing to relitigate matters that were raised or could have been raised ] ).

Corp. v Barry ( Sup Ct, Rensselaer County, July 27, 1995, Ceresia, J., affd 236 AD2d 754 ) — a case, we note, that did not involve the application of res judicata — defendants further assert that they were not in privity with Northwood Estates during the bankruptcy proceeding. Again, we are unpersuaded. To establish privity, “ the connection between the parties must be such that the interests of the nonparty can be said to have been represented in the prior proceeding ” ( Green v Santa Fe Indus., 70 NY2d 244, 253 ; see, Tamily v General Contr. Corp., 210 AD2d 564, 566 ). The concept requires a flexible analysis of the facts and circumstances of the actual relationship between the party and nonparty in the prior litigation ( see, Matter of Slocum v Joseph B., 183 AD2d 102, 104 ) and privity will exist where individuals “ so controlled the conduct of the prior litigation in which they were interested such that the result is res judicata against them ” ( Tamily v General Contr. Corp., supra, at 566 ). Defendants were intimately involved in the bankruptcy proceeding. Notwithstanding the fact that they were represented by counsel separate from the debtor ’ s counsel, it is undisputed that they signed all pertinent paperwork in that proceeding, including the chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and reorganization plan, were present during negotiations of the plan and agreed to it and attended hearings before the Bankruptcy. Court, including the confirmation hearing. As the sole partners of Northwood Estates, defendants clearly possessed * 817controlling status over the bankruptcy proceeding ( see, Green v Santa Fe Indus., supra, at 254 ; see generally, Sterling Doubleday Enter. v Marro, 238 AD2d 502, 503 ; cf., Tamily v General Contr. Corp., supra, at 566 ) and were afforded ample opportunity to litigate the counterclaims, which were scheduled as partnership assets ( cf., Nationwide Mech. Contrs. Corp. v Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, 188 AD2d 871, 872, lv denied 81 NY2d 711 ). Significantly, neither counsel for Northwood Estates nor counsel for defendants raised an objection to the reorganization plan on the ground that it did not take these claims into consideration ( see generally, Matter of Baudoin v Bank of La Fayette, 981 F2d 736, 741 - 743 ). Moreover, while defendants correctly point out that actual or potential conflicts of interest between a party and nonparty in previous litigation “ will negate the necessary element of adequate representation to establish privity ” ( Matter of Slocum v Joseph B., supra, at 105 ), no such conflict of interest has been demonstrated here as between the partnership Northwood Estates and defendants, its general partners ( compare, In re New Era Co., 115 BR 41, 45, affd 125 BR 725 ).

5026468_1,2093,"MONTGOMERY, Judge. C. D. Carpenter and Logan E. Patterson, both attorneys, have petitioned this Court to prohibit the Honorable Courtney - C. Wells, Judge of the Perry Circuit Court, from compelling them to answer certain questions or from punishing them for their continued rfefusals to answer the questions or to make certain disclosures. On December 12, 1961, H. C. Cantrell and four other former employees of Jewell Ridge Coal Corporation sued Jewell Ridge for various sums alleged to be due them under the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1950. They claimed a lien under KRS 376. 150 and 376. 160 and sought to have it enforced on all of the property of Jewell Ridge to satisfy the payment of their claims. The depositions of Carpenter and Patterson were taken by counsel for the employees on February 20 and April 12, 1962, respectively. Both depositions were taken by way of discovery, as stated in the response filed herein, and as captioned in the action pending between H. C. Cantrell, et al. v. Jewell Ridge Coal Corporation. Carpenter and Patterson refused to answer certain questions asked. Following * 526hearings the orders complained of were entered. The depositions show that at that time Carpenter was the president of Kentucky River Coal Corporation, described as a landholding company engaged in leasing various tracts of Eastern Kentucky land for the extraction of coal. Patterson, in his deposition, described his connection with the Blair Fork Coal Company as attorney and nominal vice president. Carpenter testified that on or about August 7, 1961, a coal mine lease in which Kentucky River was the lessor and Jewell Ridge the lessee had been canceled. By the termination agreement, Jewell Ridge retained no rights in the leasehold or the effects and improvements thereon. Subsequently, the same property was re - leased by Kentucky River to Blair Fork. In essence, the questions which petitioners refused to answer were designed to elicit information concerning the terms of the cancellation agreement and of the re - lease agreement, the disposition of the improvements and equipment used by Jewell Ridge, the relation, if any, between Jewell Ridge and Blair Fork, and the organization and identity of the stockholders of Blair Fork. Neither the petitioners nor Kentucky River and Blair Fork are parties to the Jewell Ridge lawsuit. It is alleged in the petition that none of them has any pecuniary interest in the outcome of the Jewell Ridge action ; that neither Carpenter nor Kentucky River has ever owned any stock in Jewell Ridge or Blair Fork and that neither of them has any proprietary interest in either Jewell Ridge or Blair Fork except by reason of the two leases ; that neither Patterson nor Blair Fork has ever owned any stock or other proprietary interest in Jewell Ridge ; that Jewell Ridge and Blair Fork are entirely separate corporations, without either owning stock in the other and without common stockholders, officers, or directors ; and that there exists no contractual or other relationship between the corporations. These allegations are neither admitted nor denied by respondent. At the hearing concerning Patterson, counsel for Jewell Ridge appeared and offered to file a performance bond with good corporate surety “ in order to obviate the inconvenience, expense, and embarrassment of further inquiries allegedly seeking assets of Jewell Ridge. ” The bond tendered was regular on its face, but counsel for the employees objected to its being filed and questioned the authority of the agent to sign the bond and the genuineness of the signature. The persistence in seeking the information after refusal of a performance bond on superficial grounds casts some doubt on the sincerity of the inquiry. Petitioners assert that since September 1961, Blair Fork and the United Mine Workers of America have been jointly involved in charges, investigations, and proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board. They contend that the employees ’ counsel, who are the regularly retained counsel for United Mine Workers, are using the deposition takings as a means to gain information to be used in the NLRB proceedings. It is apparent at once that two extraordinary legal processes are involved : discovery and prohibition. Depositions may be taken for the purpose of discovery or for use as evidence in an action, or for both purposes. CR 26. 01. Unless limited by CR 30. 02 or 30. 04, the scope of examination permitted in depositions taken is limited to “ matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action. ” CR 26. 02. Petitioners contend that the matters inquired about were privileged and were not relevant. The latter contention is dispositive. In Foremost Promotions v. Pabst Brewing Co., D. C., 15 F. R. D. 128, the rule is stated thus : “ It is the duty of the court to keep the inquiry within reasonable bounds and to restrict questions to those having substantial relevancy to a sensible investigation. ” * 527Relevancy under F. R. Civ. P. 26 ( b ), 28 U. S. C. A. has been defined as relevancy to the subject matter involved rather than as relevancy limited by the precise issues presented by the pleadings. Kaiser - Frazer Corporation v. Otis & Co., D. C., 11 F. R. D. 50 ; Rose v. Bourne, Inc., D. C., 15 F. R. D. 362. However, where, as here, “ there being before the Court nothing but the complaint and answer, the pleadings are the touchstone by which the subject matter of the action is determined. ” Bullard v. Universal Millwork Corporation, D. C., 25 F. R. D. 342. As determined by the pleadings, and as admitted by respondent, the subject matter of the action is the amount of wages owed, if any, by Jewell Ridge to certain employees and the existence of a statutory lien. Nowhere in the record of that action is there any alleged connection with either petitioner or Kentucky River, Blair Fork, or their properties. No allegations of fraud, concealment, or insolvency are made as the bases for proceeding against the properties of Kentucky River or Blair Fork. No property owned by Kentucky River or Blair Fork was described or identified as belonging to Jewell Ridge. The only reference in the complaint to the property of Jewell Ridge is in the prayer wherein a lien is prayed against the property, described in general terms, “ used an its mining operation. ” The inquiries made concerned the private affairs of nonparties to the. action and were not relevant to the subject matter of the action. Arlington Glass Co. v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., D. C., 24 F. R. D. 50. Nor can the questions be justified on the ground that they appear to ' be reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. North River Barge Line, Inc. v. Grace Line, Inc., D. C., 8 F. R. D. 117. If it be true, as petitioners charge, that the inquiries were made to gain information to be used in a matter pending before the National Labor Relations Board, they would appear to. have been made for a collateral purpose, which has been condemned. Radio Corporation of America v. Solat, D. C., 31 F. Supp. 516. Hence, the same conclusion is reached as in Proctor & Gamble Distributing Co. v. Vasseur, Ky., 275 S. W. 2d 941, wherein the Court concluded that the purpose of the inquiry was to learn whether or not Proctor & Gamble Distributing Company was the alter ego or distributing agency of Proctor & Gamble Company. It was pointed out that the information sought might become important if judgment should be obtained and prove to be noncollectible. It was concluded that the questions asked were not relevant and that the lower court erroneously required answers thereto. Obviously, petitioners as nonparties have no remedy by appeal. There is no adequate remedy other than by prohibition. The supervisory power of this Court under Section 110 of the Kentucky Constitution has been invoked in cases where in addition to the element of great and irreparable injury there is some aspect of injustice. Schaetzley v. Wright, Ky., 271 S. W. 2d 885. Injustice was there defined as “ something in the nature of usurpation or abuse of power by the lower court, [UNK] * * such as to demand that the Court of Appeals step in to maintain a proper control over the lower court, * *. The object of the supervisory power of the Court of Appeals is to prevent miscarriage of justice. ” The rule in such cases is that if an erroneous order results in a substantial miscarriage of justice, the showing of great and irreparable injury as ordinarily defined is not an absolute necessity. Bender v. Eaton, Ky., 343 S. W. 2d 799. The aspect of substantial injustice without an adequate remedy by appeal or otherwise prompts the remedial action under Section 110. The Schaetzley rule was approved in Ison v. Bradley, Ky., 333 S. W. 2d 784, cited by respondent, which is not in point since petitioners there were held to have, had adequate remedy by appeal. * 528Petitioners are faced with punishment for contempt of court for refusing to answer questions which are not relevant to the issues in the action involved. It is considered that the threatened action of the lower court in the absence of an adequate remedy by appeal constitutes a usurpation or abuse of power with the requisite element of great and irreparable injury sufficient to justify the exercise of this Court ’ s power under Section 110 of the Kentucky Constitution in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice.

Arlington Glass Co. v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., D.C., 24 F.R.D. 50. Nor can the questions be justified on the ground that they appear to 'be reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. North River Barge Line, Inc. v. Grace Line, Inc., D.C., 8 F.R.D. 117. If it be true, as petitioners charge, that the inquiries were made to gain information to be used in a matter pending before the National Labor Relations Board, they would appear to .have been made for a collateral purpose, which has been condemned. Radio Corporation of America v. Solat, D.C., 31 F. Supp. 516. Hence, the same conclusion is reached as in Proctor & Gamble Distributing Co. v. Vasseur, Ky., 275 S.W.2d 941, wherein the Court concluded that the purpose of the inquiry was to learn whether or not Proctor & Gamble Distributing Company was the alter ego or distributing agency of Proctor & Gamble Company. It was pointed out that the information sought might become important if judgment should be obtained and prove to be noncollectible. It was concluded that the questions asked were not relevant and that the lower court erroneously required answers thereto. Obviously, petitioners as nonparties have no remedy by appeal. There is no adequate remedy other than by prohibition. The supervisory power of this Court under Section 110 of the Kentucky Constitution has been invoked in cases where in addition to the element of great and irreparable injury there is some aspect of injustice. Schaetzley v. Wright, Ky., 271 S.W.2d 885. Injustice was there defined as “something in the nature of usurpation or abuse of power by the lower court, ⅜ * * such as to demand that the Court of Appeals step in to maintain a proper control over the lower court, * *. The object of the supervisory power of the Court of Appeals is to prevent miscarriage of justice.” The rule in such cases is that if an erroneous order results in a substantial miscarriage of justice, the showing of great and irreparable injury as ordinarily defined is not an absolute necessity. Bender v. Eaton, Ky., 343 S.W.2d 799. The aspect of substantial injustice without an adequate remedy by appeal or otherwise prompts the remedial action under Section 110. The Schaetzley rule was approved in Ison v. Bradley, Ky., 333 S.W.2d 784, cited by respondent, which is not in point since petitioners there were held to have,had adequate remedy by appeal. *528Petitioners are faced with punishment for contempt of court for refusing to answer questions which are not relevant to the issues in the action involved. It is considered that the threatened action of the lower court in the absence of an adequate remedy by appeal constitutes a usurpation or abuse of power with the requisite element of great and irreparable injury sufficient to justify the exercise of this Court’s power under Section 110 of the Kentucky Constitution in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice.

3935898_1,3691,"This suit was filed by the appellee, the Citizens ' National Bank of Plainview, Tex., in the county court of Hale county, Tex., against C. E. Lock and F. M. Lock, the appellants, on a promissory note payable to the order of G. A. Henderson, which was negotiated by Henderson to the appellee bank. The appellants claim that the note was procured by fraud, of which appellee had full knowledge, was without consideration, and was in contravention of the antitrust laws of the state. The trial court, after the close of the evidence, instructed the jury to find for the plaintiff against the defendants Lock for the principal and interest of the note and 10 per cent. attorneys ' fees. At the time of the execution of the note, a written contract was executed by G. A. Henderson and C. E. Lock and F. M. Lock, by the terms of which the Locks were ostensibly appointed as sole and exclusive agents for the sale of a combined educational chart, drawing board, and writing desk, in Smith county, Tex., from the 14th day of December, 1911, to August 9, 1917, in consideration of the agents purchasing from Henderson 36 of said articles at $ 8. 50 per chart, to be delivered f. o. b. Muncie, Ind., and to be shipped to Lock Son within 30 days from the date of the contract ; the said Henderson granting to the said Lock Son an equal right with Henderson and his other agents to have all orders filled by the manufacturer at Muncie, Ind., according to the manufacturer ' s contract with Henderson at the wholesale price of $ 1. 50 per chart. Besides the exclusive agency for the sale of the charts in Smith county, Lock Son were granted another agency with equal privilege with Henderson and his other authorized agents, to sell said chart in the counties of Hale, Swisher, Floyd, and Briscoe, for the same period of time. Aside from the written contract, as abbreviated above, appellants testified, in substance, that Henderson orally represented that as to the Panhandle counties named no other person would have any right to sell the chart in that territory and that no other person would be able to purchase the same chart except from him ( Henderson ), the latter claiming absolute control over the sale of the same, that none of the agents were permitted to sell the charts for less than $ 8. 50 each and stated that they were constructed out of the best oak wood ; however, testifying that they read the contract and the note and signed the same. The appellants stated that the 36 charts received by them were made of inferior material, and that in attempting to sell the charts in some of the Panhandle territory it developed that they were in competition with other charts listed by a mail order house at $ 2. 75, which, with the freight added, would have made the chart cost in that territory $ 3. 25, and, because other firms were selling the same chart in other territory for less money, the particular contract to them was worthless. At the time the written contract and the note were executed, C. E. Lock addressed a letter at the solicitation of Henderson, to the Citizens ' National Bank, the appellee, as follows : "" I have this day made one note, payable to G. A. Henderson, for $ 306. 00, due November 15, 1912. Will be agreeable with me for you to take up my note. "" When Henderson negotiated the note to the bank, he presented the letter, and the bank discounted the note about 10 per cent., and we infer from the record that this transpired within a short time after the execution of the note and contract. The president of the bank testified that he had an idea that the note purchased was given for school supplies ; that an agent of Henderson, selling charts for him, was staying at his house at that time ; that he knew nothing of * Page 538 any statements made to Lock by Henderson, and, as we construe the record, this is the only knowledge of any fact in connection with the transaction possessed by any officer of the bank. Appellants contend that the discount is such, coupled with the purchase of the note in suit from a stranger, and the knowledge of the bank that C. E. Lock, the father, was solvent, was such constructive notice as to put the bank upon inquiry. The case of Oppenheimer et al. v. Farmers ' Merchants ' Nat. Bank, 97 Tenn. 19, 36 S. W. 705, 33 L. R. A. 767, 56 Am. St. Rep. 778, by the Supreme Court of Tennessee, cited by appellant upon another proposition, is authority against the contention. It is true that the real amount of the consideration in some cases and under some circumstances is important in determining good faith and constructive notice in the purchase of negotiable paper. The amount paid by a purchaser of paper executed by a solvent maker may be so disproportionate to the face value of the security, and especially so if bought from a stranger, which would imply a guilty knowledge, or a willful ignorance of facts, in connection with the execution of the paper which could have been ascertained by reasonable inquiry. However, it is uniformly held that the rule does not require the full face of the paper to be paid in its purchase, and a contrary principle would not only deprive commercial paper of one of the most essential and valuable incidents of negotiability — that is, the sale of same — but necessarily affect the business and commerce of the country. King v. Doane, 139 U. S. 166, 11 S. Ct. 465, 35 L. Ed. 87. The officers of the bank testified that they relied upon the letter in the purchase of the paper. It was some time after the execution of the contract and the negotiable paper in question that the Locks received the shipment of the charts purchased. If the paper had been sold to the bank prior to the delivery of the charts and the bank had inquired of the Locks, what information would they have received as to any fraud between the Locks and Henderson? The Locks had none until they received the charts and attempted to sell the same. We necessarily overrule the assignment insisting upon this contention. Neither do we think that it is sufficiently shown that the note, as a part of the contract, is in violation of the anti - trust statute of this state. This contract has the usual earmarks of a sale of the exclusive right to vend a patented article throughout a specified district, especially as to Smith county. The Locks testified that Henderson informed them that the article was patented, and if so the evidence suggests that Henderson assumed to control it. The object of the patent law is monopoly, "" and the rule is, with few exceptions, that any conditions which are not in their very nature illegal with regard to this kind of property, imposed by the patentee and agreed to by the licensee for the right to * * * sell the article, will be upheld by the courts. The fact that the conditions in the contracts keep up the monopoly or fix prices does not render them illegal. "" Bement Son v. National Harrow Co., 186 U. S. 91, 22 S. Ct. 755, 46 L. Ed. 1069. A contract of the character indicated by the quotation was held by that court as not void as an unlawful restraint on interstate trade or commerce and was not forbidden by the act of Congress on that subject. The Supreme Court of Texas held, in the case of Albertype Co. v. Gust Feist Co., 102 Tex. 219, 114 S. W. 791, that where the former agreed to sell the latter 2, 000 copies of souvenir albums, and further agreed not to sell any of said albums in the city of Galveston for one year to any other person, where the articles were to be manufactured in a foreign state and shipped into this state, was not a contract in contravention of our antitrust statute for the reason that the transaction under consideration constituted interstate commerce, and such commerce is not subject to the anti - trust laws of this state. This contract seems to contemplate the right of the Locks to purchase charts at a certain price, to be manufactured at Muncie, Ind., with which the said Henderson had another contract providing for the sale and manufacture of same. If it were not a patented article, we are inclined to think that interstate commerce is such a salient feature of the contract as that the Supreme Court case cited would apply to this record. The appellants also contend that if there was fraud between the maker and the original payee, and the note was fraudulently put into circulation, the bank as an innocent holder should be limited in its recovery to the amount that it paid for the note with interest and attorneys ' fees on that amount, and cite the following cases in support of the contention : Sperlin v. Peninsular L. D. Co., 103 S. W. 232 ; People ' s Nat. Bank v. Mulkey et al., 61 S. W. 528 ; Oppenheimer v. Farmers ' Merchants ' Bank, 97 Tenn. 19, 36 S. W. 705, 33 L. R. A. 767, 56 Am. St. Rep. 778 ; Campbell v. Brown, 100 Tenn. 245, 48 S. W. 970. The two latter are Tennessee cases. Daniel on Negotiable Instruments asserts the same doctrine, with a conflict of authority, though by the different courts of the country on the question. The Supreme Court of this state, however, in the case of Petrie Bro. v. National Bank, 83 Tex. 427, 18 S. W. 752, 29 Am. St. Rep. 657, adopted the rule on this subject declared by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Cromwell v. Sac County, 96 U. S. 60, 24 L. Ed. 681 : "" A purchaser of negotiable security before maturity, in cases where he is not personally chargeable with fraud, is entitled to recover its full amount against its maker, though he may have paid less than its par value, whatever may have been its * Page 539 original infirmity. "" The same question again arose in the case of Petri Bro. v. Fond du Lac Nat. Bank, 84 Tex. 212, 20 S. W. 777, and was again decided in the same manner. We are unable to grasp the distinction between paper fraudulently put in circulation and any other fraud in connection with the execution of negotiable paper as to the rights of an innocent holder who has paid value without notice. There are cases, of course, where a negotiable note has been fraudulently put in circulation, in which, with reference to the inception of the paper and circulation of same, the holder, although innocent, has not any rights whatever ; but such cases are not applicable here. The rule of the Supreme Court of the United States, followed by our court, is based upon what is considered as the better policy as an aid to commerce in the use of such paper as an evidence of credit in substitution for actual money. Our Supreme Court having adopted the rule, we are concluded by its decision. The appellants insist that the evidence did not justify a peremptory instruction for the attorneys ' fees, because that feature of the note is merely a contract of indemnity. Our Supreme Court, in the case of First National Bank of Eagle Lake v. Robinson, 135 S. W. 372, concludes the appellant on this question. There is an absence of plea and proof in this case by the appellants that the attorneys ' fees agreed upon in the note are unreasonable, or unconscionable ; hence "" the court is authorized to act upon the amount of such fees as agreed upon by the parties and enter judgment accordingly. "" Upon the above consideration of this record, the cause having been decided upon its merits, it is unnecessary to pass upon the question of the result of a failure to except to a charge of the court, where the instruction to the jury is peremptory. We conclude that the action of the trial court was correct, and the judgment is in all things affirmed. On Motion for Rehearing. In this cause the written contracts in substance set out in our original opinion, if deemed contracts of sale, on the question of the same being condemned by our anti - trust statutes, upon a close consideration and the comparative legal effect between the same and the one considered by the Supreme Court of the state in the case of Albertype Co. v. Gust Feist Co., 102 Tex. 219, 114 S. W. 791, we think clearly places this cause, on that question, within the scope of that case, and not within the purview of the case of Watson Medical Co. v. Johnson et al., 162 S. W. 394. If appellee contends that the testimony of the Locks, as to the statements made by Henderson prior to the time that the written contracts were made, brings this cause within the scope of the latter case cited, and that the contract, viewed as a whole, supplemented by this oral testimony, as the contract between the parties, is condemned by the case last cited, the answer is in the condition of this record that the testimony as to the previous statements and representations made by Henderson cannot constitute the contract between them. The rule that a written memorial which merges previous negotiations excludes such proof is for the reason that the testimony is incompetent. Wigmore says ( volume 4, § 2300, subd. 1 ) : "" The rule is in no sense a rule of evidence, but a rule of substantive law. It does not exclude certain data because they are for one or another reason untrustworthy or undesirable means of evidencing some fact to be proved. * * * What the rule does is to declare that certain kinds of fact are legally ineffective in the substantive law ; and this, of course ( like any other ruling of substantive law ), results in forbidding the fact to be proved at all. "" The Supreme Court of the state, in the case of Henry et al. v. Phillips, 105 Tex. 466, 151 S. W. 538, with reference to a certain character of testimony in a case different in its status from the cause here, announced, however, what we believe to be the same principle, when it said : "" Such incompetent testimony can never form the basis of a finding of facts in an appellate court, notwithstanding its presence in the record without objection. When the appellate court comes to apply the law to testimony constituting the facts of the case, it can only base its conclusion upon such testimony as is under the law competent. That which is not competent testimony should be given no probative force. "" While we are not inclined to think the oral testimony would bring this cause within the principle of the case of Watson Medical Co. v. Johnson, supra, however, when we come to the written contract, we are clearly of that opinion. Appellants insist that the trial court committed error as follows : On cross - examination of the cashier of the bank, the witness had testified that he could not tell exactly what the bank gave Henderson for the note, but to the best of his recollection it was an amount less about a 10 per cent. discount ; that he could not testify to the exact amount without going to the book at the bank recording the purchase. Counsel for defendants asked the witness to secure the book and from it give the exact amount paid for the note. The court stated that he did not consider the amount as material and that it would take up too much time to secure the book. The president of the bank, who negotiated the purchase of the note, had testified that they had discounted the note about 10 per cent. When the bank purchased the note, whatever amount they paid for it, if they had inquired of the Locks in regard to the transaction between the latter and Henderson, the only information that the Locks could have imparted to the officers of the bank was that they had made a * Page 540 certain contract with Henderson for the purchase of certain charts and the right to purchase more to sell in certain territory, upon certain representations made by Henderson. Whether false or true, or fraudulent or not, at that time no one knew or had any means of knowing. We concede there are cases where the court could have abused his discretion in refusing to suspend or delay a case, even though a litigant has not attempted to avail himself of the proper process to obtain information from the opposite party, or to compel the production of his papers into court ; but under the record here we do not think an abuse of discretion upon the real merits of the cause is exhibited. We refuse to certify to the Supreme Court a question which we conceive has been previously decided by that court, in the case of Petri Bro. v. National Bank, 83 Tex. 427, 18 S. W. 752, 29 Am. St. Rep. 657, and again repeated in 84 Tex. 212, 20 S. W. 777. The motion for rehearing is in all things overruled.",3935898,"This suit was filed by the appellee, the Citizens' National Bank of Plainview, Tex., in the county court of Hale county, Tex., against C.

The court stated that he did not consider the amount as material and that it would take up too much time to secure the book. The president of the bank, who negotiated the purchase of the note, had testified that they had discounted the note about 10 per cent. When the bank purchased the note, whatever amount they paid for it, if they had inquired of the Locks in regard to the transaction between the latter and Henderson, the only information that the Locks could have imparted to the officers of the bank was that they had made a *Page 540 certain contract with Henderson for the purchase of certain charts and the right to purchase more to sell in certain territory, upon certain representations made by Henderson. Whether false or true, or fraudulent or not, at that time no one knew or had any means of knowing. We concede there are cases where the court could have abused his discretion in refusing to suspend or delay a case, even though a litigant has not attempted to avail himself of the proper process to obtain information from the opposite party, or to compel the production of his papers into court; but under the record here we do not think an abuse of discretion upon the real merits of the cause is exhibited. We refuse to certify to the Supreme Court a question which we conceive has been previously decided by that court, in the case of Petri Bro. v. National Bank, 83 Tex. 427 , 18 S.W. 752 , 29 Am.

3738388_1,3067,"This is a suit by appellee, William H. Schwan, as executor of the last will and testament of George Meinert, deceased, for the construction of that will. Appellants, Sophia Meinert and others, are beneficiaries under the will, and from the decision of the Court of Common Pleas they have appealed to this court on questions of law. Appellee was nominated in the fourth and final clause of the will as both executor and trustee thereof, and the part concerning which he asked the instruction of the court was the following, immediately after the customary first provision as to payment of just debts and funeral expenses : "" Item 2. I give, devise and bequeath to my sisters Mary Meinert and Sophia Meinert equally share and share alike the full use and enjoyment and income from all my property real and personal of every kind and description so long as each of my said sisters may live, giving each of them full right and privilege to use, enjoy, mortgage or sell any part or all of my property, real or personal, should either of my sisters wish, desire or elect to do so during their lifetime for their comfort or support. The rights herein given to my sisters to continue to the survivor in the event of the death of either sister. I further direct and authorize my executor hereinafter appointed, whom I also name as my trustee, to carry out the above terms of my will to pay all doctor and hospital bills, medicines, nurses, funeral expenses required for either of my sisters Mary and Sophia and charge the same to and pay same from my estate. "" I further order, direct and authorize my trustee * Page 338 and executor hereinafter appointed to purchase and cause to be erected at my grave and that of my two sisters Mary and Sophia one family or large monument and a separate marker for each grave, said trustee and executor to use his own judgment and discretion in the purchases thereof. "" Item 3. After the death of my sisters Mary and Sophia, I give, devise and bequeath the remainder or residue of my property, real and personal, to my brother Willis Meinert and my nephew Daniel Blankemeier each the undivided one - half thereof and to their heirs forever. "" Item 4. I hereby nominate W. H. Schwan of Luckey, Ohio, to be the executor and trustee of this my last will and testament hereby authorizing and empowering my executor and trustee to carry out the terms of my will, to adjust and settle all claims and debts which may be due from or to my estate, giving my said executor full authority to sell at public or private sale my property, real or personal, and make necessary deeds and instruments of conveyance the same as I might or could do if living. "" The questions as to which the appellee, as executor, asked the instruction of the court were the following : 1. As to the estate, title and interest that the said Sophia and Mary Meinert take in the property, both real and personal ; that is, whether they take the property in fee or only a life estate therein. 2. As to the rights and duties of the trustee named in said will, and as to the commencement of and the duration of time which said trusteeship shall be continued. 3. As to the rights and duties of the executor named in the will, especially as to the distribution of the property of said estate and of the rights of the remaindermen named in the residuum of the will. * Page 339 The decree of the Court of Common Pleas, omitting certain formal findings and parts, was : "" The court finds that it was the intention of the testator, George Meinert, to create a trust and that a trust is created by the terms of his said last will and testament ; that by the terms of his will the defendants Mary Meinert and Sophia Meinert are given and devised a life estate in all of his property, real and personal, and that after their deaths, and each of them, the remainder or residue of the property, real and personal, is given and devised one - half thereof to Willis Meinert, and the other undivided one - half thereof to Helen Blankemeier and Esther Blankemeier and to their heirs forever. * * * "" It is therefore ordered and decreed by the court that a trust is created by the terms of the will of George Meinert, deceased ; that a life estate is given and devised to Mary Meinert and Sophia Meinert in all the property, real and personal, belonging to said George Meinert at the time of his decease, and that after the deaths of the said Mary Meinert and Sophia Meinert, and each of them, then that the remainder of the property, real and personal, is given and devised one - half thereof to Willis Meinert, and the other undivided one - half thereof to Helen Blankemeier and Esther Blankemeier, and to their heirs forever. "" The court further orders that the executor of the said George Meinert, deceased, proceed and administer his estate through the Probate Court of Wood county, Ohio, and that the same be closed within a reasonable time, and that upon the settlement of said administration said executor deliver over to the trustee named in the will of the said George Meinert, deceased, all the assets and property of said estate in his hands as executor, said trustee to be appointed and qualified in the Probate Court of Wood county, Ohio, after which said estate and property shall be held and * Page 340 administered by said trustee so appointed, all in accordance with the terms of the said last will and testament of George Meinert, deceased. "" At the outset it will be observed that the foregoing decree contains an inconsistency in that it determines that a trust is created by this will, which the court does not define as to the corpus thereof, while at the same time the decree finds that the appellants have a life estate in all of the property of testator, both real and personal. If a trust was created by this will, then as to the property included within such trust, the trustee holds the legal title, while the beneficiaries hold the equitable title. But a life estate vests both legal and equitable title in the same person. Therefore, a trust and a life estate cannot exist in the same property at the same time. Furthermore, the Court of Common Pleas did not find or decree that appellants, regardless of the nature of their interest in this property, were given a definite power to use, mortgage or sell any or all of the principal, during their respective lifetimes, should they elect so to do for their comfort or support. In the construction of a will, two cardinal rules are to be observed : First, that the intention of the testator is to be sought from an examination of the entire instrument, and, second, that the will shall be construed, if possible, so as to give effect to every part of it, if it be possible by so doing to reconcile provisions which are in apparent conflict. An examination of this will discloses at the outset that no express words are used conveying the title of either the real or personal property left by testator to his sisters. The language is : "" I give, devise and bequeath * * * the full use and enjoyment and income from all my property real and * Page 341 personal of every kind and description so long as each of my said sisters may live. "" On the other hand, neither did the testator use any apt words conveying the legal title to any of this estate to his trustee. And yet it cannot be doubted that the testator intended to convey the legal title to some part of his estate to the trustee, from which funds could be derived for the purpose of paying not only doctor and hospital bills and for medicine and nurses for his sisters during their life, but also their funeral expenses and the expense of a separate marker for each of their graves after their respective deaths. The question is, therefore, where does the title to this real and personal property vest during the lifetime of the appellants? It cannot be held in abeyance during that period, but in the absence of any clearly dispositive words in the will, it must vest by implication either in the trustee or the appellants. As we have said, the legal title cannot be both in the trustee and the appellants at the same time. If it be held that the appellants take title during their lives to all of testator ' s property, then nothing remains for the corpus of the trust, and all the provisions of the will concerning the appointment of a trustee and his duties are nullified. On the other hand, if a trust was created, then an estate for life, vesting the legal title as well as the equitable during that period, cannot exist. With these principles in mind, we have reached the following conclusions : We find that the intention of the testator was to make the fullest possible provision from his estate for the care, maintenance and support of his two unmarried sisters, who had lived with him for many years, during their lives ; that at the time of making this will on September 13, 1932, he unquestionably had in mind that one of these sisters, Mary Meinert, was at least * Page 342 72 years of age and the other sister was then not less than 68 years of age ; and that in order to carry out this intention testator named and appointed a trustee in his will who should take and hold his entire property in trust during the lifetimes of these two sisters for the purpose of insuring that they should be cared for. As evidencing this purpose, we observe that Item 2 of the will gave to these sisters not a specific estate for life in all his property but "" the full use and enjoyment and income "" from it. While it is true that the gift of the full income from property during the lifetime of a beneficiary has been held to imply a gift of a life estate in that property, yet this implication can only arise when no intention is apparent on the part of the testator to create a trust and separate the beneficial or equitable right to receive the income from the legal title to the corpus of the trust. Furthermore, in the present will the testator explicitly directed that his trustee, in order to insure the comfort and support of his sisters and to make adequate provision for them, should pay all doctor and hospital bills, medical, nurse and funeral expenses required for them. Therefore, in order to carry out the intentions and desires of the testator as we gather them from this will, and to give effect to all of its provisions, we find that the decree of the Court of Common Pleas should be modified in the following respects, and this court, coming now to render the judgment which the Court of Common Pleas should have rendered, finds and decrees as follows : 1. That a trust was created by the will of George Meinert, deceased, in all of the property, real and personal, comprising his estate, and that appellee, W. H. Schwan, was duly named and appointed by the testator as the trustee thereof. That the trust shall continue during the lifetime of appellants and terminate after the death of the survivor of them when the * Page 343 trustee shall have performed the final duties imposed upon him by the will as to the payment of the expenses of the last sickness and burial of each of the appellants and a placing of a marker at the grave of each. 2. That appellants are the beneficiaries of the trust and entitled, share and share alike, to the full use, enjoyment and income from all of the property so held in trust during their respective lives, with full right of survivorship. 3. That appellants and beneficiaries are each further given by this will a continuing and absolute power to use, enjoy, mortgage or sell any part of the estate, both real and personal, as they or either of them may desire or elect for their comfort and support during their respective lifetimes. Upon notice given by them or either of them that they elect or desire the use, sale, or mortgage of any or all of such real or personal property and the payment of such funds or the proceeds of such mortgage or sale to them for their comfort or support, it shall be the duty of the trustee at once to comply therewith paying each one - half, if both are living, or the entire amount to the survivor if one is then deceased. 4. The duty of the executor is to end his administration of the estate so soon as is practicable, to at once pay to appellants all accumulated income now in his hands not necessary for the payment of debts and costs of administration, and turn over all the remaining property of the estate in his possession or control to the trustee appointed under the will, who shall hold, manage and control the same until the decease of the survivor of the two appellants, paying the net income therefrom to them, or the survivor, at such periods as may be directed by the Probate Court to whom this testamentary trustee must make his reports. The duties imposed upon the trustee as hereinbefore set * Page 344 forth are likewise binding upon the executor until such time as his administration is terminated. 5. Upon the death of each appellant the trustee shall pay all unpaid bills for expenses, including funeral expenses, and also erect a marker at the grave of such deceased beneficiary, and having performed the duties enjoined upon him in such respects by the will, the trust shall then terminate on the death of the surviving beneficiary, unless previously terminated by the exhaustion of the trust estate by the exercise of the powers above referred to in finding No. 3, and such portion of the trust estate as then remains be distributed by the trustee to the persons then entitled to receive it under the provisions of Item 3 of the will. The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is therefore affirmed as herein modified and this cause is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas for execution. Judgment modified and affirmed as modified.

5458786_1,4082,"Bacon, J. The grounds on which the plaintiffs ask the relief to which they suppose themselves entitled are two fold. First, they allege that the proceedings of the defendants are calculated to do incalculable injury to the farms of the plaintiffs, by cutting off and drying up their springs, and destroying the growth of their young timber, and that these proceedings are conducted in bad faith and with the intent to injure the plaintiffs, and benefit the lands of other parties not contributing to the expense of the work ; and secondly, they insist that the act under which the defendants are assuming to perform the work in question is unconstitutional and void, as depriving the plaintiffs of their property, not for any public use, and without providing them a just compensation therefor. I shall spend no time upon the first branch of the plaintiffs ’ case, because there is no evidence whatever before me tending to show that the defendants are acting in bad faith ; and although there is some diversity of opinion whether the mode adopted by the defendants is the one best calculated to secure the result at which they are aiming, and whether the manner of its execution is the most judicious, yet this may be deemed at best a balanced question, on the evidence. Even if they err in judgment, a court would hardly be justified in interfering by the summary process of injunction to restrain their proceedings. Unless the defendants are violating the plain and manifiest intent and object of the statute under which they are acting, or are proceeding in bad faith, the court should not interpose its a, u * 168thority to suspend the work. In either aspect, I see no sufficient ground, as disclosed by the evidence, to entitle the plaintiff to the relief they ask under the first head of their complaint. The more important question, as it was the one most elaborately and ably argued by the counsel on both sides, respects the inquiry whether the act of April 16th, 1854, under which the defendants are carrying on the work of draining, the Rome swamp, is not a violation of the constitution, and therefore void. The plaintiffs ’ counsel insists that the act is a violation of the constitutional inhibition against taking private property, because, ( 1. ) It is not taken for a public use ; and ( 2. ) Because no just compensation is provided for the parties whose property is taken. I. That the property of A. cannot be taken and appropriated to the use of B., however beneficial the change may bej and that the land of private citizens cannot be occupied by the government or any subordinate functionary clothed with legislative authority, under the pretense or the claim of improving it for the benefit of the occupant or his neighbors, requires no argument to demonstrate. It is by no means easy, however, to define the precise boundaries which limit the right to appropriate private property for public use ; or, in other words, to determine when the use shall be deemed public, and when not. It is insisted by the counsel for the plaintiffs that the purposes for which the property is taken in this case are not public, because the benefit is limited to, - and the expense assessed upon, a few individuals. But how are we to determine the number to whom the benefit will be confined? In the case of draining an extensive swamp, we can readily conceive that the public health may be favorably affedted, throughout a wide region, within and bordering upon the district where the work is carried on, and it surely is for the public benefit that a large tract of land should be reclaimed from the condition of a useless morass, and added to the agricultural resources of the state. But the question returns upon us, who is to judge of the degree of necessity which exists, and which alone will warrant the action of the legislative authority in determining that private property may * 169be taken for public uses? It is now well settled, if there ever has been any well founded doubt upon the proposition, that the right of “ eminent domain ” remains in the government, or in the aggregate body of the people in their sovereign capacity, and they have the right to resume the possession in the manner directed by the organic and the statute laws of the state, whenever the public interest requires it. The answer to the question I have proposed, is perhaps no where better given than by the late chancéllor of this state in the leading case of Beekman v. The Saratoga & Schenectady Rail Road Co. ( 3 Paige, 73. ) “ If the public interest can in any way be promoted by the taking of private property, it must rest in the wisdom of the legislature to determine whether the benefit to the public will be of sufficient importance to render it expedient for them to exercise the right of eminent domain, and to authorize an interference with the private rights of individuals for that purpose. ” He adds, “ upon this principle, not only the agents of government, but also individuals and corporate bodies, have been authorized to take private property for the purpose of making public highways, turnpike roads and canals, of erecting and constructing wharves and basins, of establishing ferries, of draining sioamps and marshes, and of bringing water to cities and villages. In all such cases the object of the legislative ' grant of power is the public benefit derived from the contemplated improvement. ” The use and benefit is not required to be universal, nor, in the largest sense, even general. If it is confined to a specific district, it may still be public. If some parties are more benefited than others, this forms no objection to the use, if the public interest and convenience are thereby subserved. Isolated and individual action will rarely secure the public and general result which the legislative power is invoked to accomplish ; and, in view of all the facts in this case, it is to be assumed that the legislature adjudged that the public necessity or utility justified the exercise of the right of resumption, and that the exigency existed which authorized the act in question. I do not say that a case may not exist of such palpable and gross invasion of private rights, unjustified by any semblance of pub - * 170lie necessity, that it would he the duty of the courts to interfere for the protection of such rights, by pronouncing the act a violation of the salutary principle which was designed to hold the legislative authority in check. But the case must be very clear to warrant this interference. On this part of the case, it is pertinent also to remark, that for the last fifty years, at least, the legislature has exercised the power in question here, by passing laws from time to time, authorizing, in various forms, the draining of swamps and marshes, and the reclaiming of submerged lands. More than twenty such acts will be found in the session laws of the state, commencing as early as 1804, and continuing at various intervals down to the very last session of the legislature, when the act in question was passed. This course of legislation is by no means conclusive when a constitutional question arises, which may never have been agitated in the courts, - under any of those acts. And we have been admonished by more than one decision that no length of time, in which a course of legislation has been continued, will protect any law from the condemnation of the judicial tribunals, when its conflict with the constitution is brought distinctly to the test. ( See opinion of Bronson, J. in Taylor v. Porter, 4 Hill, 140. ) While, therefore, it is not affirmed that. these acts may be appealed to as decisive of the power of the legislature to pass them, and that they are not within the constitutional objection we have been considering, they nevertheless do lend some strength to the argument that a power so long exercised, in such diversified forms and various localities, may be deemed settled, as applied to the subject we are now considering. Looking then at the principle which lies at the foundation of the right of the government to take private property for public use by an appropriate act of legislation, and the end which in this case may be fairly deemed the object and intent of the act, I shall - find no difficulty in maintaining it as the lawful exercise of the right of eminent domain, and holding that the taking of the lands of these plaintiffs, so far as it was necessary to enter upon and appropriate them for the purpose intended in this case, was and is a lawful taking of the same for a public use. • * 171II. But there is an important condition connected with the exercise of this power on the part of the government to take private property for the public use ; and that is, the necessity of providing a just compensation to the parties whose property shall be thus appropriated. This condition is fundamental and imperative, and can only be satisfied by making such a provision as shall be in truth “ just, ” or, in other words, adequate and compensatory. “ The principle, ” says Oh. J. Savage, ( Matter of Canal street, 11 Wend. 154, ) “ that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation is found in the constitution and laws of this state, and has its foundation in those elementary principles of equity and justice which lie at the root of the social compact. ” And this provision must be made cotemporaneously with, and as a part of, the act which authorizes the appropriation : For, in the language of Oh. Walworth, ( 18 Wend. 17, ) “ Before the legislature can authorize the agents of the state and others to enter upon and occupy, or destroy or materially injure, the private property of an individual, except in case of actual necessity "" which will not admit of delay, an adequate and certain remedy must be provided, whereby the owner of such property may compel the payment of his damages or compensation, and he is not bound to trust to the justice of the government to make provision for such compensation by future legislation. ” And Kent, ( 2 Com. 389, ) recognizes the same doctrine when he says, “ a provision for compensation is a necessary attendant on the due and constitutional exercise of the power given to deprive an individual of his property without his consent, and the principle is founded in natural equity, and is laid down by jurists, as an acknowledged principle of universal law. ” Bearing these principles in mind, and that by the term “ just compensation, ” as used in the constitution, is to be understood “ a fair equivalent in money — a quid pro quo, a recompense in value for the property taken, ” ( Per Mason, senator, 18 Wend. 35 ; ) and remembering also that when private "" property is taken for public use by right of eminent domain, it is taken not as the owner ’ s share of contribution to a public burthen, but as so much * 172beyond bis share — let us see whether the act of the legislature, under which the proceedings of the defendants in this case have been taken, fulfills the constitutional requirement on that subject. By the 3d section of the act of April 17th, ( Session Laws of 1854, p. 1000, ) it is made the duty of the commissioners to assess the costs and expenses of the survey and the cutting of the ditches, and to apportion the amount among the several owners of lands to be drained, according to the number of acres respectively owned by each. This provision, it will be seen, devolves the whole expenses upon the parties owning the lands to be drained ; and that not in the ratio of relative benefit, but simply upon a property basis, and by an equal assessment upon every acre throughout the swamp. The rule is highly objectionable in respect to the mode of providing for the expenses, but is probably within the scope of the legislative discretion as one form of the exercise of the taxing power. These burthens never can be very equally adjusted, and there is no glaring injustice in requiring those persons to pay the expenses, who are supposed to receive an equivalent in the enhanced value of their own adjacent property. On examining the act further, to ascertain what provision has been made for the damages or compensation to be made to the owner whose lands are entered upon and taken, we find the 11th section declares, that for any damages done to the owner or owners of such lands, ( fee., the commissioners shall make just compensation ; and after providing for their appraisal in the proper mode, it is declared that such damages, and the costs of assessment and the per diem > of the commissioners, shall be duly certified and “ assessed and collected as part of the expenses of the drainage authorized by this act. ” The effect of the provision is to make the damages or compensation to be collected and payable precisely as the expenses are, to wit, by assessing the same upon the owners of the land, according to the number of acres owned by each. But is this the “ just compensation ” contemplated and required by the constitution? Most obviously, it seems to me, it is not. The taking of land necessary for the work, and the dispossession of the owner ’ s right and title thereto, is only to be vindicated on the ground ' * 173that it is required for a public use. If the improvement is required for the public benefit, upon what principle can the public benefited by the appropriation, be exempted from their proper contribution to the just indemnification of the parties whose property has been taken? The land appropriated is not the owner ’ s share of a contribution to a public burthen, but is so much above and beyond his share. He should be compensated, therefore, and the compensation should be made in good part, if not entirely, by those who are benefited by the work accomplished, either in the increased salubrity of the surrounding region, or the enhanced value of the lands which lie in the immediate neighborhood. But by the operation of this section, the owner not only loses his land, but is compelled to pa. y a portion of the very damages he has sustained by such loss and the other consequential injuries he may have suffered thereby. The money which is supposed to satisfy the damages suffered by the owner may, in one sense, be said to find its way into one of the pockets of the proprietor ; but to accomplish that trick of legal legerdemain, it must first be taken out of the other. Is this the “ just compensation ” the constitution contemplates? Does it practically do any more than “ Keep the word of promise to the ear, To break it to the hope. ” Besides, the burthen will of necessity be very unequally apportioned among those who are doomed to bear it. It is incredible that every owner of land in the swamp will suffer equal injury and receive equal benefit from the work in question ; and the testimony in this case shows that such is not the fact. A. is the owner of 20 acres, which is a mere morass, having no available springs upon it, and no growth of timber which the progress of the work uproots and destroys. B., on an adjoining lot, has. both springs indispensable for the uses to which he is applying his already partially reclaimed land and a growth of young timber, very valuable for farming purposes. And yet, under the law as it stands, B. pays precisely at the same rate, as a compensation towards the damages he has suffered, that A. does, who has not only suffered no injury, but has been greatly benefited by * 174the appropriation of the land and the execution of the work. This clearly is no just compensation, but a most inequitable distribution of the burthens, which ought to be in some proximate proportion to the benefits. It is urged by the counsel of the defendants that the act in question follows the precedents of prior legislation on the same subject, and is formed on the model of various acts which have authorized similar works. I have looked through most of the acts on this subject in our session laws for many years, and it is true that in "" a great majority of cases no provision whatever has been mad § for ascertaining or paying the compensation required to be made. These laws have been probably acquiesced in by the parties who were interested in or affected by them, and no question has been made in the courts, as far as I am aware, respecting their constitutional validity. If there had been, I am unable to see how they could have escaped judicial condemnation. But this has not been the invariable course of legislation on this subject ; for on examining the act of April, 1816, for draining the great marsh on the Caneseraga creek, I find an express provision, that in case any person shall suffer injury or damage by occasion of the canal and drainage of the land, his damages shall be ascertained by the commissioners, and assessed on the proprietor of such lands “ as would in any wise be benefited or made more valuable, by reason of the canal ” to be cut for the purpose of draining the said swamp. And the same provision was made in reference to the expenses, which were to be assessed in like manner, “ having reference to the benefit to be received by each of the proprietors. ” So also in the act of April, 1825, for draining the Cayuga marshes, it was made the duty of the commissioners, when the work should be completed, to prepare an assessment roll and valuation of the land reclaimed, and all other lands which in their opinion shall have been increased in value by the lowering of the waters of the marsh, and assess a tax to pay for the work, “ in an equal and just measure according to the valuation in the assessment roll, ” adequate to meet the expenses of the work. And a substantially similar provision is contained in the act of * 175February, 1822, for lowering Onondaga Lake, and draining the marsh lands in the town of Salina. [ Oneida Special Term, December 4, 1854. Bacon, Justice. ] These acts contain the proper provisions, and are, it seems to me, founded on the true principle which ought to govern legislation on the subject of appropriating private property for public uses. Nothing could have been easier than to have inserted in the act we have been considering, a section containing a provision similar to the one found in these acts, to which I have referred, and thus have secured all the benefits which are expected to, and doubtless. will, flow from a judicious discharge of the duties devolved upon these defendants, while it preserved all the constitutional guaranties which have been thrown around the rights of the private citizen. Future legislation may possibly ’ -, even now, remedy this omission, giving validity to what has already been done, but providing for that just indemnity and compensation to which it shall be found the parties are ultimately entitled. But whether this be so or not, the duty of the courts in a case where their interposition is invoked to stay proceedings under a law which violates a glain _ constitutional provision, is clear and imperative, and must be performed. , The plaintiffs are accordingly entitled to the relief demanded in the complaint, restraining the defendants from further proceedings under the act in question. But as the defendants have been charged with a public duty, under the apparent sanction of an act of the legislature, and have acted in entire good faith, the judgment must be without costs against them.",5458786," Bacon, J. The grounds on which the plaintiffs ask the relief to which they suppose themselves entitled are two fold. First, they allege that the proceedings of the defendants are calculated to do incalculable injury to the farms of the plaintiffs, by cutting off and drying up their springs, and destroying the growth of their young timber, and that these proceedings are conducted in bad faith and with the intent to injure the plaintiffs, and benefit the lands of other parties not contributing to the expense of the work; and secondly, they insist that the act under which the defendants are assuming to perform the work in question is unconstitutional and void, as depriving the plaintiffs of their property, not for any public use, and without providing them a just compensation therefor. I shall spend no time upon the first branch of the plaintiffs’ case, because there is no evidence whatever before me tending to show that the defendants are acting in bad faith; and although there is some diversity of opinion whether the mode adopted by the defendants is the one best calculated to secure the result at which they are aiming, and whether the manner of its execution is the most judicious, yet this may be deemed at best a balanced question, on the evidence. Even if they err in judgment, a court would hardly be justified in interfering by the summary process of injunction to restrain their proceedings. Unless the defendants are violating the plain and manifiest intent and object of the statute under which they are acting, or are proceeding in bad faith, the court should not interpose its a,u*168thority to suspend the work. In either aspect, I see no sufficient ground, as disclosed by the evidence, to entitle the plaintiff to the relief they ask under the first head of their complaint. The more important question, as it was the one most elaborately and ably argued by the counsel on both sides, respects the inquiry whether the act of April 16th, 1854, under which the defendants are carrying on the work of draining, the Rome swamp, is not a violation of the constitution, and therefore void. The plaintiffs’ counsel insists that the act is a violation of the constitutional inhibition against taking private property, because, (1.) It is not taken for a public use; and (2.) Because no just compensation is provided for the parties whose property is taken. I. That the property of A. cannot be taken and appropriated to the use of B., however beneficial the change may bej and that the land of private citizens cannot be occupied by the government or any subordinate functionary clothed with legislative authority, under the pretense or the claim of improving it for the benefit of the occupant or his neighbors, requires no argument to demonstrate. It is by no means easy, however, to define the precise boundaries which limit the right to appropriate private property for public use; or, in other words, to determine when the use shall be deemed public, and when not. It is insisted by the counsel for the plaintiffs that the purposes for which the property is taken in this case are not public, because the benefit is limited to,-and the expense assessed upon, a few individuals. But how are we to determine the number to whom the benefit will be confined ? In the case of draining an extensive swamp, we can readily conceive that the public health may be favorably affedted, throughout a wide region, within and bordering upon the district where the work is carried on, and it surely is for the public benefit that a large tract of land should be reclaimed from the condition of a useless morass, and added to the agricultural resources of the state. But the question returns upon us, who is to judge of the degree of necessity which exists, and which alone will warrant the action of the legislative authority in determining that private property may *169be taken for public uses ? It is now well settled, if there ever has been any well founded doubt upon the proposition, that the right of “ eminent domain” remains in the government, or in the aggregate body of the people in their sovereign capacity, and they have the right to resume the possession in the manner directed by the organic and the statute laws of the state, whenever the public interest requires it. The answer to the question I have proposed, is perhaps no where better given than by the late chancéllor of this state in the leading case of Beekman v. The Saratoga & Schenectady Rail Road Co. (3 Paige, 73.) “ If the public interest can in any way be promoted by the taking of private property, it must rest in the wisdom of the legislature to determine whether the benefit to the public will be of sufficient importance to render it expedient for them to exercise the right of eminent domain, and to authorize an interference with the private rights of individuals for that purpose.” He adds, “ upon this principle, not only the agents of government, but also individuals and corporate bodies, have been authorized to take private property for the purpose of making public highways, turnpike roads and canals, of erecting and constructing wharves and basins, of establishing ferries, of draining sioamps and marshes, and of bringing water to cities and villages.

5856723_1,1114,"In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, plaintiff appeals ( 1 ) from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County ( Beckinella, J. ), dated September 29, 1980, which, inter alia, granted the defendant hospital ’ s motion to quash subpoenas served upon four of its employees, and ( 2 ) as limited by her brief, from so much of a further order of the same court ( Leone, J. ), dated May 22, 1981, as, upon reargument, adhered to its original determination. Appeal from the order dated September 29, 1980, dismissed as adacemic. Said order was superseded by the order, dated May 22, 1981, issued upon reargument. Order dated May 22 ; 1981, affirmed insofar as appealed from, without prejudice to a formal application by the plaintiff for the taking of additional depositions consistent herewith. Respondent is awarded one bill of $ 50 costs and disbursements. This action was commenced by service of a summons and verified complaint upon the defendant hospital on or about February 9, 1979. Although named as a defendant in the action, Dr. Stanley Dratler was never served. The complaint alleges that on or about December 23, 1977 the plaintiff was a patient at the defendant hospital and that defendant Dratler, a resident physician in the hospital ’ s employ, wrongfully and maliciously injected her with valium and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her while she was in a drugged and helpless state. The complaint against the hospital contains two causes of action. The first asserts that Dratler ’ s acts were * 848committed with knowledge, express or implied, of the defendant hospital and constituted a grossly negligent and willful interference with the plaintiff ’ s person. The second cause of action asserts a breach of the hospital ’ s contractual duty to the plaintiff to furnish her with competent and adequate medical care in conformity with the recognized practice in the community, and to keep her free from harm and danger while at the hospital. On March 6, 1980, pursuant to court order, Edith Steinberg, the supervisor of medical correspondence in the defendant hospital ’ s medical records department, was deposed. She produced the plaintiff ’ s medical record and testified as to its completeness. Ms. Steinberg asserted, however, that she did not know Dr. Dratler and had no knowledge of either the manner in which employee personnel files are kept in the hospital or the process by which residents and interns are selected for matriculation. Upon inquiry as to who would have that knowledge, Ms. Steinberg replied that she thought that the individual departments in the hospital would have the information. Upon further questioning, Ms. Steinberg offered the names of four hospital officials : the current administrator of the hospital, the head of the personnel records department, and two physicians who were the heads of medical service. On or about April 25, 1980 plaintiff served subpoenas and notices to take deposition upon each of the four individuals named by Ms. Steinberg. Each subpoena called upon the named individual to appear at 2 : 00 p. m. on May 29, 1980. On May 22, 1980 the defendant hospital moved for an order quashing the subpoenas. Special Term granted the motion and subsequently adhered to its determination upon reargument. We now affirm. The liberalization of discovery procedures ( see CPLR 3101 et seq. ) has not altered the general rule that, in the first instance, a corporation may designate which of its officers, directors or employees shall represent it for the purposes of pretrial depositions ( see Instructional Tel. Corp. v National Broadcasting Co., 63 AD2d 644 ; Lonigro v Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 22 AD2d 918 ). Where additional persons are sought to be deposed, the examining party must make a formal application to the court and must carry the burden of demonstrating that the corporate representatives already deposed possessed insufficient knowledge or were otherwise inadequate ( see Besen v C. P. L. Yacht Sales, 34 AD2d 789 ). In the instant case, it is essentially conceded that Ms. Steinberg did not possess adequate knowledge in view of the nature of the plaintiff ’ s causes of action. Nevertheless, plaintiff failed to make an appropriate motion for further discovery and, although the defendant hospital offered to produce one of the individuals named by Ms. Steinberg, the plaintiff proceeded to serve subpoenas on all four of the named individuals. Those individuals, each of whom is an important hospital official, were all commanded to appear on the same date and at the same time. Under these circumstances, we hold that Special Term did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion to quash ( see CPLR 3103, subd [ a ] ; Dow u Xciton Corp., 75 AD2d 972 ). If she is so advised, the plaintiff may make a proper application for further discovery so as to permit the court to supervise disclosure and to avoid harassment and minimize inconvenience to the hospital ( see Dow v Xciton Corp., supra, at p 973 ). Mollen, P. J., Mangano, Brown and Rubin, JJ., concur.",5856723," In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, plaintiff appeals (1) from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Beckinella, J.), dated September 29, 1980, which, inter alia, granted the defendant hospital’s motion to quash subpoenas served upon four of its employees, and (2) as limited by her brief, from so much of a further order of the same court (Leone, J.), dated May 22, 1981, as, upon reargument, adhered to its original determination. Appeal from the order dated September 29, 1980, dismissed as adacemic. Said order was superseded by the order, dated May 22, 1981, issued upon reargument. Order dated May 22; 1981, affirmed insofar as appealed from, without prejudice to a formal application by the plaintiff for the taking of additional depositions consistent herewith. Respondent is awarded one bill of $50 costs and disbursements. This action was commenced by service of a summons and verified complaint upon the defendant hospital on or about February 9, 1979. Although named as a defendant in the action, Dr. Stanley Dratler was never served. The complaint alleges that on or about December 23, 1977 the plaintiff was a patient at the defendant hospital and that defendant Dratler, a resident physician in the hospital’s employ, wrongfully and maliciously injected her with valium and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her while she was in a drugged and helpless state. The complaint against the hospital contains two causes of action. The first asserts that Dratler’s acts were *848committed with knowledge, express or implied, of the defendant hospital and constituted a grossly negligent and willful interference with the plaintiff’s person. The second cause of action asserts a breach of the hospital’s contractual duty to the plaintiff to furnish her with competent and adequate medical care in conformity with the recognized practice in the community, and to keep her free from harm and danger while at the hospital. On March 6,1980, pursuant to court order, Edith Steinberg, the supervisor of medical correspondence in the defendant hospital’s medical records department, was deposed. She produced the plaintiff’s medical record and testified as to its completeness. Ms. Steinberg asserted, however, that she did not know Dr. Dratler and had no knowledge of either the manner in which employee personnel files are kept in the hospital or the process by which residents and interns are selected for matriculation. Upon inquiry as to who would have that knowledge, Ms. Steinberg replied that she thought that the individual departments in the hospital would have the information. Upon further questioning, Ms. Steinberg offered the names of four hospital officials: the current administrator of the hospital, the head of the personnel records department, and two physicians who were the heads of medical service. On or about April 25, 1980 plaintiff served subpoenas and notices to take deposition upon each of the four individuals named by Ms. Steinberg. Each subpoena called upon the named individual to appear at 2:00 p.m. on May 29, 1980. On May 22, 1980 the defendant hospital moved for an order quashing the subpoenas. Special Term granted the motion and subsequently adhered to its determination upon reargument. We now affirm. The liberalization of discovery procedures (see CPLR 3101 et seq.) has not altered the general rule that, in the first instance, a corporation may designate which of its officers, directors or employees shall represent it for the purposes of pretrial depositions (see Instructional Tel.

6155711_1,2521,"Max J. Wolff, Referee. The defendant, a foreign corporation, engaged in the manufacture and sale of fire brick and clay, appears specially herein and objects to the jurisdiction of the court, contending that it is not doing business within the State and is not subject to the process of this court in an action brought against it by a resident of New York. Defendant ’ s home office is in Cleveland, Ohio, and it maintains factories in various parts of the United States, but none in New York. There is to be found, however, in the office building at 50 Church street, within the city of New York, a small office which bears defendant ’ s name, and no other, upon the entrance door thereof. Defendant ’ s name is also posted upon the bulletin board in the lobby of that building. The New York City Telephone Directory lists the defendant at the 50 Church street address. Letterheads of the defendant in use at the New York office carry defendant ’ s Cleveland address, but contain in addition thereto the following notation, conspicuously printed in red letters : “ Address reply to 50 Church Street, phone Cortlandt 7 - 3963, New York, N. Y. ” The lease of the office in question is in the name of an employee of the defendant, one H. B. Titus. Mr. Titus testified that he is the acting district sales manager of the defendant within the State of New York, and also that he signs various communications as district representative. He testified that the defendant employs one other salesman in New York who is his subordinate, and that the two men make their headquarters at the office leased by Titus. This office is devoted entirely to defendant ’ s business. The rent therefor is paid with funds supplied by the defendant to Titus for that purpose and for other expenditures incidental to the conduct of the office and of defendant ’ s business. The funds are kept by Titus in a local bank in an account entitled, “ H. B. Titus, Special ; ” the average amount on deposit is $ 400. The furniture in the office, of slight value, is owned by the defendant. It must be conceded that defendant ’ s property within the State is negligible. * 766The salaries of Titus and the other salesman are paid by the defendant ’ s home office. Titus and his associate salesman are employed on a salary basis and devote all their time to the business of the defendant. Titus employs a young woman stenographer and pays her out of the aforementioned “ H. B. Titus, Special ” account. Defendant has no other employees in New York. Titus and his associate are constantly and systematically engaged within the State of New York in soliciting business for the defendant. Their activities result in the continuous shipment by the defendant of its product into and outside of the State of New York. It was testified by Titus that the shipments into this State attain a monthly average of approximately $ 14, 000. Shipments are made in every case from factories without the State “ f. o. b. plant. ” Orders received by Titus from new customers are transmitted to the home office in Cleveland and are there accepted or rejected, presumably after due investigation of the customer ’ s credit standing. In the case of orders received from approved accounts, that is to say, from customers who have previously done business with the defendant and whose credit standing has been found satisfactory by the defendant ’ s home office, and who have thus established a permanent relationship with defendant ’ s New York office, Titus promptly transmits the order to the factory, by means of a teletype machine which the defendant caused to be installed in the 50 Church street office for the use of Titus. This practice is always followed in the case of a rush order from an approved account if the amount of the order is not unusually large ; and the testimony affords some reason to suppose that it is followed in the case of every normal - sized order from such an account. As a general rule, prices are established by the Cleveland office, but Titus was sometimes authorized to quote varying prices in order to meet competition. Orders received on the basis of prices thus quoted by Titus required the approval of the home office, but were, as a matter of fact, in no instance rejected. Defendant ’ s customers in New York make payment directly to the Cleveland office, but when instructed to do so, Titus undertakes the collection of delinquent accounts. The facts here outlined resemble closely those present in Tauza v. Susquehanna Coal Co. ( 220 N. Y. 259 ). The principles of that case and of Cochran Box & Mfg. Co., Inc., v. Monroe Binder Board Co. ( 197 App. Div. 221 ; affd., 232 N. Y. 503 ) are controlling. The presence of a solicitor or of an agent within the State does not subject the corporation which employs him to the jurisdiction of the State where he operates. The position of Titus, however, is of considerably greater import than that of a mere solicitor or agent * 767and the extended activities in which he and his associate are engaged are sufficient to subject the defendant to the processes of the courts of this State. The controlling force of Tauza v. Susquehanna Coal Co. ( supra ) has been questioned to some extent ( e. g., Day & Co. v. Schiff, Lang & Co., 278 Fed. 533 ; Halpern v. Pennsylvania Lumber Industries, 137 Misc. 688 ). It was conceived that the State courts, in determining whether a corporation is doing business within the State, are invariably bound to follow the Federal decisions. This conception was supported in a measure by the following dictum found in Chipman, Ltd., v. Jeffery Co. ( 251 U. S. 373, at p. 379 ) : “ we do not wish to be understood that the validity of such service as here involved would not be of federal cognizance whatever the decision of a state court. ” However, in Kansas City Structural Steel Co. v. Arkansas ( 269 U. S. 148, at p. 150 ) it was said : “ We accept the decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas as to what constitutes the doing of business in that State within the meaning of its own laws. ” In the light of Kansas City Structural Steel Co. v. Arkansas ( supra ), it is clear that each State may determine for itself whether a foreign corporation is doing business within the State within the meaning of its own laws unless assumption by the State courts of jurisdiction over the foreign corporation is so unreasonable as to come into conflict with the due process requirements of the Federal Constitution. In the instant case the extent and nature of defendant ’ s activities within the State are such that it is actually brought here and is properly subjected to the jurisdiction of this court. Since the due process provisions of the Federal Constitution are not involved and since there is nothing to show that the service effected upon the defendant constitutes an undue burden upon interstate commerce, no Federal question is presented and the decisions of the courts of this State should be followed. The defendant places reliance upon. Pennrich & Co., Inc., v. Juniata Hosiery Mills, Inc. ( 247 N. Y. 592 ). Examination of the record discloses that the foreign corporation in that case operated through an agent who acted on a commission basis and who sold goods, also on a commission basis, for one other manufacturer. Such an agent is not an employee of the foreign corporation but is independent thereof and his presence and activities do not bring the corporation into the State. The entrance door of the office occupied by the sales agent carried the name of the agent and of both companies he represented, and was maintained for the transaction of the business of the agent, to be distinguished from * 768that of the corporation, which did not, so far as appears, pay the rent or office expenses. Davega, Inc., v. Lincoln Furniture Mfg. Co., Inc. ( 29 F. [ 2d ] 164 ), relied upon by the defendant, resembles Pennrich & Co., Inc., v. Juniata Hosiery Mills, Inc. ( supra ) in the respect that the agent of the foreign corporation in the former case, as well as in the latter, “ received no salary, but was only paid a commission based upon the contracts which originated through him, and not upon the amount realized. ” While the agent in Davega, Inc., v. Lincoln Furniture Mfg. Co., Inc. ( supra ), like Titus, collected delinquent accounts, his collection work seems to have been voluntary or gratuitous. Titus ’ collection work is in the line of his regular duties as defendant ’ s salaried employee. Hand, C. J., writing for the court in Davega, Inc., v. Lincoln Furniture Mfg. Co., Inc. ( supra ), said : “ This is a very close case. ” The additional factors present in the instant case require a different conclusion than that reached in the Davega Case ( supra ). Even if a choice must be here made between the Federal and State court decisions, the latter will be deemed determinative. ( Kansas City Structural Steel Co. v. Arkansas, supra. ) In view of the activities of defendant hereinbefore narrated, it is impossible to arrive at the conclusion that the defendant is not “ doing business ” within the State without wholly losing sight of the meaning ordinarily attributed to that phrase by men engaged in business. While the common understanding of the phrase is not controlling and is frequently of necessity disregarded, nevertheless, common sense suggests that it be accorded some consideration. Not only are the defendant ’ s employees engaged in constant activity within the State with the result that large quantities of defendant ’ s goods are continually shipped into the State, not only are orders received here from customers who maintain a permanent relationship with defendant sent directly to the factories without the prior approval of the home office, not only are collections of delinquent accounts frequently made here by a salaried employee of the defendant, but the defendant actually has a place of business within the State. The office occupied by defendant ’ s employees, for the exclusive use of defendant ’ s business, maintained out of defendant ’ s funds, must be regarded as defendant ’ s place of business. Because of the attendant circumstances, the legalistic device of leasing the office in the name of defendant ’ s employee is ineffective. Accordingly, I find that the defendant is doing business within the State. * 769Schimmel, J. This motion to vacate service was referred to Max J. Wolff to hear and report upon the issue as to whether the defendant, a foreign corporation, is doing business within the State. In his opinion attached to his report, the referee has accurately stated the relevant facts established at the hearing had before him. It clearly appears that the nature and extent of defendant ’ s activities within the State are such that the service effected here upon its managing agent is without doubt valid under the applicable State and Federal decisions.

S. 579. ) The cases, both State and Federal, cited in opposition to the confirmation of the report disclose in every instance a condition of affairs much different from that which is present here ; in each of those cases the activities of the foreign corporation were not sufficiently comprehensive to bring it within the jurisdiction of the particular State ; those cases are found to be not comparable to the present situation with respect either to the corporate activities or the duties and authorities of the corporate employees.

8836719_1,1234,"Shipman, J. This is a bill in equity, based upon the alleged infringement of two letters patent, Nos. 296, 623 and 296, 624, which were granted April 8, 1884, to Frederick Richardson ; one of said patents being for a die for securing heel - plates to rubber shoes, and the other being for a machine for the same purpose. A motion under this bill for a preliminary injunction was refused as to the machine patent, and was granted as to the die patent, but that injunction was afterwards dissolved. The opinion upon the motion stated the important facts, which had then been disclosed, in regard to each patent, each invention, and the alleged infringing devices. 33 Fed. Rep. 281, 838. Nothing is required to be added in regard to the questions which are at issue upon the machine patent. * 690The plaintiff insists, inasmuch as there had been previously no machine for securing metallic heel - plates to rubber shoes, that a liberal construction should be given to the patent, and that machines performing the same functions by analogous means should be regarded as infringing devices. The peculiarity of the Richardson machine consists in the mechanism by which the shoe and the heel - plate, which is placed upon the “ holder, ” are held and guided. In the Richards machine there is no equivalent, and no analogous mechanism, for holding and guiding. The holding and guiding devices in the two machines are entirely different. The other patent is the less important one, but, it having received from the experts and from counsel more careful. investigation than it had upon the hearing of the motion, I have also examined it with more attention, and do not now think that it is being infringed. The prongs of the Richardson heel - plate w ' ere studs, which had enlarged bases, serving as plugs, and flattened clinching ends. The first operation of the die was, in the language of the specification, “ to curve the ends of the pins or nails without bending the portion in the material of the heel. ” Continuation of the pressure clinched the pins, and compressed the rubber around their shanks, so that water could not enter the shoe. The die was so constructed that the ends of the pins only could be bent. The specification says that to insure the bending of the lower part of the pins, without affecting the upper part of the frame, and also to insure the close fitting of the pins in the rubber, the die was provided with radially placed inclined planes, the incline of which was placed in opposite directions, so as to bend the ends of the pins in opposite directions. These planes were depressions in the surface of the die, so that the entire planes were below the upper surface of the die, and consequently the ends only of the pins were bent, and the plugs were intentionally not bent. Continued pressure compressed the rubber around the entire plug. By virtue of the radially placed planes, the clinching surfaces of the die bend and clinch the ends of the pins in a line parallel with the edge of the die block, whereby, it is thought, the rubber is especially compressed between the bent portions and the inner surface of the heel - plate. By a disclaimer, which was recently filed, the owner of the patent disclaimed a heel - die whose inclines are not “ faced in opposite directions. ” These words, the disclaimer explains, mean that some of the inclined clinching surfaces are faced or inclined in a direction substantially opposite to that or those in - which other of the inclined clinching surfaces are inclined or faced. This feature is said to be important, so - that the clinching strains may be balanced, and the plate may be evenly imbedded in and evenly secured to the heel. The operative part of the defendant ’ s die consists of projections above its surface, whereby the prongs, which are slender throughout their length, aré set in the rubber by one stroke of the plunger. One side, which is the working face, of each projection is concave. The die of ordinary size has five projections, three of which are not radially placed. The highest elevations of the. two end projections are on radial lines, centering at the same point. The first operation of the defendant ’ s die is to curve * 691the ends of the prong, but the entire slender prong is intentionally bent. The die has no system of similarly arranged planes. The defendant construes the patent to be for a set of radially placed inclines, having their faces in opposite directions ; the inclines being arranged either in two equal sets, bending the prongs away from each other in each set, or in pairs which bend the adjoining prongs towards each other. If a die contained, in connection with non - radially placed inclines, a single pair of radially placed inclines, which in fact performed the office which the Richardson die performs, I should be disposed to regard such a die as an infringer, although it did not have a complete set of Richardson inclines. But if a die, having irregularly placed inclines, contains also two radially placed inclines, which are or are not isolated from each other, but which do not perform the office which the Richardson die was designated. to perform and does perform, I do not think that such a die, although containing radially placed planes, is an infringing die. These inclines cannot do the work of the Richardson die upon the Richardson plate or upon the Richards plate, because they bend the entire shank. If the shank or plug of the Richardson prong should be bent, the heel - plate would be injured or destroyed. The Richards die is designed to bend the entire prong, and is therefore a different thing from the Richardson die. The bill is dismissed.",8836719," Shipman, J. This is a bill in equity, based upon the alleged infringement of two letters patent, Nos. 296,623 and 296,624, which were granted April 8, 1884, to Frederick Richardson; one of said patents being for a die for securing heel-plates to rubber shoes, and the other being for a machine for the same purpose. A motion under this bill for a preliminary injunction was refused as to the machine patent, and was granted as to the die patent, but that injunction was afterwards dissolved. The opinion upon the motion stated the important facts, which had then been disclosed, in regard to each patent, each invention, and the alleged infringing devices. 33 Fed. Rep. 281, 838. Nothing is required to be added in regard to the questions which are at issue upon the machine patent. *690The plaintiff insists, inasmuch as there had been previously no machine for securing metallic heel-plates to rubber shoes, that a liberal construction should be given to the patent, and that machines performing the same functions by analogous means should be regarded as infringing devices. The peculiarity of the Richardson machine consists in the mechanism by which the shoe and the heel-plate, which is placed upon the “holder,” are held and guided. In the Richards machine there is no equivalent, and no analogous mechanism, for holding and guiding. The holding and guiding devices in the two machines are entirely different. The other patent is the less important one, but, it having received from the experts and from counsel more careful .investigation than it had upon the hearing of the motion, I have also examined it with more attention, and do not now think that it is being infringed. The prongs of the Richardson heel-plate w'ere studs, which had enlarged bases, serving as plugs, and flattened clinching ends. The first operation of the die was, in the language of the specification, “to curve the ends of the pins or nails without bending the portion in the material of the heel.” Continuation of the pressure clinched the pins, and compressed the rubber around their shanks, so that water could not enter the shoe. The die was so constructed that the ends of the pins only could be bent. The specification says that to insure the bending of the lower part of the pins, without affecting the upper part of the frame, and also to insure the close fitting of the pins in the rubber, the die was provided with radially placed inclined planes, the incline of which was placed in opposite directions, so as to bend the ends of the pins in opposite directions. These planes were depressions in the surface of the die, so that the entire planes were below the upper surface of the die, and consequently the ends only of the pins were bent, and the plugs were intentionally not bent. Continued pressure compressed the rubber around the entire plug. By virtue of the radially placed planes, the clinching surfaces of the die bend and clinch the ends of the pins in a line parallel with the edge of the die block, whereby, it is thought, the rubber is especially compressed between the bent portions and the inner surface of the heel-plate. By a disclaimer, which was recently filed, the owner of the patent disclaimed a heel-die whose inclines are not “faced in opposite directions.” These words, the disclaimer explains, mean that some of the inclined clinching surfaces are faced or inclined in a direction substantially opposite to that or those in -which other of the inclined clinching surfaces are inclined or faced. This feature is said to be important, so- that the clinching strains may be balanced, and the plate may be evenly imbedded in and evenly secured to the heel. The operative part of the defendant’s die consists of projections above its surface, whereby the prongs, which are slender throughout their length, aré set in the rubber by one stroke of the plunger. One side, which is the working face, of each projection is concave. The die of ordinary size has five projections, three of which are not radially placed. The highest elevations of the. two end projections are on radial lines, centering at the same point. The first operation of the defendant’s die is to curve *691the ends of the prong, but the entire slender prong is intentionally bent. The die has no system of similarly arranged planes. The defendant construes the patent to be for a set of radially placed inclines, having their faces in opposite directions; the inclines being arranged either in two equal sets, bending the prongs away from each other in each set, or in pairs which bend the adjoining prongs towards each other. If a die contained, in connection with non-radially placed inclines, a single pair of radially placed inclines, which in fact performed the office which the Richardson die performs, I should be disposed to regard such a die as an infringer, although it did not have a complete set of Richardson inclines. But if a die, having irregularly placed inclines, contains also two radially placed inclines, which are or are not isolated from each other, but which do not perform the office which the Richardson die was designated. to perform and does perform, I do not think that such a die, although containing radially placed planes, is an infringing die. These inclines cannot do the work of the Richardson die upon the Richardson plate or upon the Richards plate, because they bend the entire shank. If the shank or plug of the Richardson prong should be bent, the heel-plate would be injured or destroyed. The Richards die is designed to bend the entire prong, and is therefore a different thing from the Richardson die. The bill is dismissed.

8019719_1,7772,"WALKER, P. J. Relief by habeas corpus is invoked by petitioners in this court to effect their discharge from an alleged unauthorized judgment of commitment for contempt rendered against them by the judge of the circuit court of Cole County. The writ was granted as prayed and made returnable on a day certain. The sheriff of Cole County, who held petitioners in custody, made return to the writ, to which petitioners filed their reply. The facts as set out in the judgment of commitment with which the return is in accord, having been put in issue by the reply of petitioners, the court appointed Yirgil Y. Huff, Esq., as a special commissioner, to take testimony concerning the disputed facts and report his findings of fact and conclusions of law in relation thereto. The commissioner having heard the testimony, filed herein a transcript of same, together with his. findings and conclusions in conformity with the order of his appointment. To this report the sheriff filed his formal exceptions. The issue has, been presented in extenso. Counsel for the respective parties have argued the matter orally and have filed printed briefs and arguments herein. The facts out of which this proceeding arose are as follows : In November, 1917, there was pending in the circuit court of Cole County, in which Hon. John G. Slate presides as judge, a criminal case entitled the State v. John W. Scott, in which the defendant was charged with the larceny and embezzlement of coal belonging to the State. The Attorney - General had been directed by the Governor to appear and assist the prosecuting attorney in the trial of this ease. Petitioners, representing the Attorney - General and at his behest, appeared in the circuit court and tendered their service to assist the prosecuting attorney. The latter, refused to par -, * 104ticipate in the prosecution, whereupon the court announced that the case would be conducted for the - State by the petitioners. The latter having secured a formal entry permitting the endorsement of the names of certain witnesses on the indictment, announced ready for trial, but requested, in addition, that the State be not restricted in the selection of triers of the fact to the regular panel of jurors, for the reason that during that term of court and a few days prior thereto, a trial panel had been chosen from these jurors, the members of which had sat in the trial and had rendered a verdict of acquittal in a criminal. case charging a like offense, similar in all of its material features to the one then before the court, and against this same defendant. The court overruled petitioners ’ suggestion, announcing that the jury was not disqualified for the reason stated by petitioners. Furthermore, the court announced in response to an inquiry of petitioners, that the ruling made during the trial of the former case of like character to that before the court and alsoi against said Scott, in regard to testimony of similar transactions by him at or near the time of the - act charged in the pending indictment, would be adhered to in the trial of this case ; and that testimony of this character would not be admitted to show intent or for any other purpose. Petitioners then withdrew their announcement of ready for trial and stated that they desired time to file an application for a change of venue on account of the prejudice of the judge against the State. Upon the petitioners having signed and made oath to said application before the clerk of the court, the judge ordereá it not to be filed until he had read it. After reading it the court granted petitioners leave to file same. This was done and at once overruled by the court. Counsel for defendant then announced ready ' for trial. Mr. Ewing, one of the petitioners, then asked for time within which to apply to the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition against the judge, on the ground of a lack of jurisdiction after the filing of the application for a charge of, venue. The court refused to grant * 105time for that purpose, his language being, “ That will be refused. You must proceed with this case. ” To which Mr. Ewing replied : “ I decline to proceed on account of the attitude of the judge. ” ■ To which the latter replied : “ I permitted you to file this application for a change of venue although I thought it was a frivolous proceeding. If, however, the representatives of the Attorney - General ’ s office want to parade their ignorance before this court and the attorneys present, I guess, I can stand it, but I want to warn you that I am getting tired of your frivolity and that you won ’ t tamper any longer with the court, adding : “ Proceed with the trial of this case. Either continue, dismiss or go on with the trial. The witnesses are present, the jurors are on hand and the defendant has answered ready and he is entitled to a trial at this time. I want to know what you are going to do? ” To which Mr. Ewing said : “ You are evidently about to fine us for contempt, but before you do so 1 want to say that we never filed a pleading with greater earnestness than when we filed this application for a change of venue. ” The judge, after again ordering them to proceed, said : “ In view of the fact that you have filed in this court a motion which, to say the least, is frivolous, and because you refuse as representatives of the Attorney - General ’ s office to proceed with this case, I will adjudge you guilty of contempt and fine you fifty dollars each, and I want satisfactory proof that these fines are paid out of your own pockets and not. out of the Attorney - General ’ s contingent fund. ” “ We decline to jpay the fines, ” said Mr. Ewing. “ In that event, ” said the judge, “ you are ordered committed to jail until the fines are paid or you are discharged by due course of law. ” Addressing the sheriff, the judge said : “ Mr. Richter, take charge of these attorneys. ” Mr. Ewing then said to the court : “ If it is necessary for somebody to go to jail in order that the State may get justice in this case, I am ready to go. ” “ Be careful, ” said the judge, “ or I will fine you again. ” Prom time to time during this scene petitioners askecl that the court require the official stenog * 106rapher to make a note of the proceedings in the order of their occurrence. The stenographer took a position in front of the court ’ s bench preparatory to taking notes of the proceeding when the court interrupted him saying : “ Never mind about that. This is a matter between the attorneys and the court. ” The stenographer thus admonished did not take the notes. The variance between the facts, as disclosed in the testimony and as they appear in the findings of the trial court ’ s judgment, renders a full transcript of the latter necessary to a correct understanding of the case. Omitting the caption, certificate of the clerk as to the correctness of the transcript of the judgment, and incorporating only the body of the application for a change of venue, the judgment and order of commitment are as follows : “ Whereas, Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, duly licensed and practicing attorneys - at - law, were adjudged guilty of contempt of court, and each of them, by the ' circuit court of Cole County, Missouri, for contempt committed in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, by its judgment then and there pronounced, ana entered of record among proceedings of said court on the 27th day of November, 1917, which said judgment was in words and figures as follows : “ It is ordered and adjudged by the court that Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, attorneys, practicing in this court, and each of them, be fined $ 50 for contempt of court committed in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, on the 27th day of November, 1917, while the circuit court of ■ Cole County, State of Missouri, was in regular session and during the sitting of said court for the transaction of business that might lawfully be brought before it for consideration, in this : That the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, did wilfully, knowingly and contemptuously file in this court, for and upon behalf of the State of Missouri in a certain cause lawfully pending in said court, what purported to be an application for a change of venue in said cause, which application for a change * 107of venue is in writing and in words and figures as follows : “ ‘ Comes now the State of Missouri, plaintiff in the above entitled canse, and files its application herein, and says that the Hon. John G. Slate, judge of this court, is prejudiced in this cause against the State, and that by reason of such prejudice, the said judge, by the terms of section 5198, Revised Statutes 1909, is disqualified and prohibited from sitting as judge of this court upon the trial of this cause. “ ‘ Wherefore, the State says this court is disqualified to proceed further in this cause, - than in accordance to the provisions of Section 5201, Revised Statutes 1909, and therefore prays that he make an order accordingly granting the State a change of venue herein. ’ “ Which said foregoing motion and application for a charge of venue was by the court overruled and denied. “ That thereafter and thereupon, and while the case of the State of Missouri v. John Scott was then and there pending before the court, wherein the said John Scott is charged with the crime of embezzlement and grand larceny, and while said Scott was present in person in court, and by counsel, and demanding a trial, within his constitutional rights, upon said charge, and the said Lee B. Ewing was present in court as special counsel for the State of Missouri, and the said S. P. Howell was present in court as Assistant Attorney - General, both of whom were in charge of said cause and prosecuting for and upon behalf of the State of Missouri, and appearing for and in the place and stead of the prosecuting attorney of Cole County, Missouri, in said cause ; and the court having then and there inquired of them as to whether or not the State of Missouri was ready for trial in said cause, and that thereupon - the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell In the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, and the regular panel of the petit jury then and there assembled, wilfully and contemptuously refused to make answer, although often requested so to do by the * 108court, and the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell did then and there state to the court that the State of Missouri could not have a fair and impartial trial before the court then sitting in said cause, and that said court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine said cause, which said statement was made in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court and the said jurors - then assembled for the trial of said - cause, and the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell then and there refused to proceed further, or to « take any further action in said cause ; that thereupon the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell were admonished by the court that they must either answer ready for trial, or ask for a continuance, or take some other proper action in said cause ; whereupon the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court and jnry, stated that they refused to do either — answer ready for trial, ask for a continuance, or take any further action in the said cause — and after being fully and duly warned by the court that their refusal to take any action whatsoever in said cause would be treated as wilful contempt by them, and each of them, of the court ; the said Ewing and Howell again stated in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court and the jnry, wilfully, knowing - ly and contemptuously, that they were willing to be adjudged in contempt of the court and go to jail in order to get justice in said cause, thereby wilfully, knowingly and contemptuously accusing the court, in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, the jury, and a large number of persons there assembled, of being partial towards the defendant, and unduly prejudiced against the State of Missouri in said cause ; and that thereafter the said Ewing and Howell refused to further answer, but wilfully and contemptuously stood mute and refused to take * any action whatever in said cause ; that the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell did then and there, in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, by their words, act and gestures, offer and commit wilful * 109contempt in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court. “ Wherefore, the court doth, by reason of the premises aforesaid, adjudge the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, in wilful contempt of the court and doth assess the ‘ punishment of the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell, and each of them, at a fine of $ 50 and that the said Lee B. Ew ' ing and the said S. P. Howell, and each of them, stand committed to the common jail of Cole County, Missouri, until said fines of each of them shall be paid, or until they shall be discharged by due course of law ; and whereas the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell, and each of them, doth refuse to pay said fines so assessed against them, it is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said Ewing and the said Howell, and each of them stand committed to the common jail of Cole County, Missouri, until said fines of each of them shall be paid, or until they shall be otherwise discharged by due course of law. “ These are, Therefore, to command you, the said sheriff of Cole County, Missouri, forthwith to convey and deliver into the custody of the keeper of the county jail of said county the body of the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, so as aforesaid found guilty of contempt and adudged by the said circuit court to be imprisoned therefor in the county jail until further order of this court, or until they be otherwise discharged by due process of law ; and you, the said keeper of the said jail, are hereby required to receive the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, into your custody and them confine in the jail of said county until the further order of this court, or until they be otherwise legally discharged by due process of law ; and for so doing this shall be your warrant. ’ ’ * 110contempt : of Judgment. I. The judgment herein from which petitioners seek relief relies for its potential force upon a finding of direct contempt alleged to have been committed in the face of the court. It is urged preclusively rather than affirmatively, that the findings of this judgment are conclusive, and that no ulterior inquiry can be made into the facts, the effect of which may be to question its validity ; the contention being in brief, as is the general rule, that the judgment imports absolute verity — its face constituting not only a certificate of the legitimacy of its origin but of its present good character. "" While the older authorities in other jurisdictions, from which the textwriters deduce statements of principles, unqualifiedly apply the general rule of immunity from collateral attack to judgments of the character here in question, we hold otherwise. Here one convicted of direct contempt in seeking relief through habeas corpus is not limited to an inquiry as to the convicting court ’ s jurisdiction, but, if the truth of the findings upon which the judgment is based is denied in the petitioner ’ s reply to the return, inquiry may be made in regard thereto. To this extent we have, as has been done elsewhere ( Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547 ; Ex parte Fisk, 113 U. S. 715 ; Ex parte Irvine, 74 Fed. l. c. 959 ), brushed aside the hard - and - fast rule which theretofore hedged about judgments for direct or criminal contempt rendering them immune from attack ; and have authorized an inquiry to test the truth of their findings. [ Ex parte Creasy, 243 Mo. l. c. 688, 694. ] The wisdom and wholesomeness of this modification of the general rule is supported by reason and justice. There is no appeal or right to a writ of error from a judgment for direct or criminal contempt ; no provision having been made therefor by statute, the right does not exist. [ In re Clark, 208 Mo. l. c. 146. ] Absent the right of appeal no opportunity for a full. review of the proceedings is afforded except by habeas corpus. Resort to the writ of certiorari some * 111times employed in other jurisdictions will not afford relief, because, as is not infrequently the case, the proceedings concurrent with and provocative of the judgment for contempt, are not preserved in the record and hence cannot be brought up for review. By invoking the aid. of habeas corpus, however, which is always construed in favor of the liberty of the citizen, an opportunity is afforded in a case of the character here under consideration, to look beyond the commitment and its recitals into the evidence and circumstances upon which the court below acted, and determine therefrom, although jurisdiction of the person ' and subject - matter be conceded, whether the court had authority to render the judgment ; or generally whether the third essential to the court ’ s right of action existed. This manner of exercise of the right of supervision and control of inferior tribunals whether it rests in the Constitution or arises out of the common law, as one of the attributes of a. court of superior jurisdiction, is held to be authorized notwithstanding the provisions of the Statute ( Sec. 2475, R. S. 1909 ) prohibiting an inquiry into the legality or justice of any process, judgment, decree or order of any court legally constituted or the justice or propriety of any commitment for contempt made by any court, body or officer and plainly charged in such commitment. It being held that although such commitment may recite the existence of the necessary jurisdictional facts to sustain it, the authority of a court or officer cannot be acquired merely by asserting it or by falsely alleging its existence, and hence the evidence may be inquired into to determine the truth. [ Ex parte Creasy, 243 Mo. l. c. 695 ; Ex parte O ’ Brien, 127 Mo. l. c. 489. ] Elsewhere similar statutes have received a like construction ( People ex rel. v. Liscomb, 60 N. Y. 559 ; People v. Cassels, 5 Hill, 164 ; Ex parte Duncan, 62 S. W. ( Tex. ) 758 ; Ex parte Juneman, 28 Tex. App. l. c. 488. ] Yiewed from every vantage the reasons for the exemption of judgments for direct contempt from the ordinary rule of immunity from collateral attack, become more apparent. In other * 112proceedings the judge stands indifferent between the parties ; the procedure is along a beaten pathway found from experience most promotive of justice ; and the judgments resulting therefrom are not only entered under the supervision of the court, but are subject, before becoming conclusive, to the scrutiny and criticism of opposing counsel. Thus rendered, the possibility of their findings incorrectly stating the facts cn which they are based are remote if not impossible. Under such circumstances it is not difficult to account for the origin and permanence in our jurisprudence of the rule ordinarily applicable that the findings of a judgment shall import verity and that its conclusion shall be ' inviolable. The characteristics of such a judgment are entirely different from those which distinguish a judgment for direct contempt. The latter is summary and in a sense ex parte in that the court is the only active factor in its rendition. Whatever part the contemner may have contributed to it was completed before the action of he court commenced. With the announcement of the punishment inflicted the judgment became final except for its formal entry upon the record. When so entered its only resemblance to an ordinary judgment is in its form. The court ’ s adjudication is a conviction and its commitment in consequence an execution. [ Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat ( U. S. ), l. c. 43. ] The judicial poise, therefore, which enables the upright judge to hold the balance of justice evenly and fairly in an ordinary case is difficult to maintain in a proceeding for ' direct contempt. This is due more perhaps to the limitations of nature than purpose on the part of the judge. Being human, his impulses and passions are subject to the same influences which actuate other men ; and while a contempt of court is, as its words clearly indicate, a manifestation of disrespect towards a tribunal in which justice is administered, the judge in whose presence and hearing the offense is committed maintains indeed the true judicial attitude, if in passing judgment on the offender, he assesses the punishment free from any feeling of personal affront. The * 113danger of this not being done constitutes an all - sufficient reason why a court of review should in a case of this character carefully. consider all of the facts leading up to the judgment to determine if justice has been fairly administered and not content itself with the conclusiveness of the face of same as in ordinary cases. A contrary ruling involves, not only in its essence but in its application, the absurd conclusion that the judge, although his fiat determines a question of personal liberty, is incapable of acting intemperately or unwisely, even where he may regard himself, through a mistaken idea of what contempt consists, as personally concerned ; or that the courts are surrounded by a sacred aura which precludes inquiry into their actions lest their dignity be lowered, their efficacy lessened or their existence endangered. Fortunately, however, for the rights of the individual — paramount to all else in a free country — form, ceremony and a blind adherence to precedent are no longer, if they ever were, dominating influences in judicial action. Year by year the rulings of courts of last resort exemplify this fact. Techflicalities are being swept away ; and precedents are followed if reason supports their application, but not otherwise. What the courts require and, demand in the wise and wholesome administration of justice is that the facts in any given case may be fully known. Justice, it is true, is typified as being blind, but only as indicative of her impartiality. Deafness has never been designated as one of her attributes. Deprived of this sense, the suitors at her shrine would receive but haphazard consideration. For these reasons, therefore, and others not necessary, in a proper conservation of time and space, to be added, we give our unqualified approval to the rule announced in the Creasy ( 243 Mo. 679 ) and O ’ Brien ( 127 Mo. 477 ) cases and impliedly endorsed in the Clark case ( 208 Mo. 121 ), to the effect that in a proceeding by habeas corpus to secure the release of one from a commitment for a direct contempt, we will look beyond the findings of the judgment where the truth of same as set forth in the * 114return is - denied by the contemner, to ascertain the full facts from which the right to the writ may be determined. insufficient Facts. II. The right of review not being confined to the findings of the commitment, let us inquire whether these findings are sufficiently in accord with the facts to sustain the judgment. If not, and the variance is in - a ^ ver ^ erL ^ R is unexcusable ; If wilful, it is worse. A more specific characterization is unnecessary because it is not conceivable, either in this or any other case, that a judge charged with the administration of justice and having a purpose only to preserve the dignity of the court in which he presides, will countenance or even tacitly consent to the making of a falsified record to sustain judicial action. Summarized, the findings upon which the - judgment is based are as follows : filing the. application for a change of venue ; declining to proceed with the trial ; saying to the court that the State could not have a fair and impartial trial in that tribunal ; that the court was without jurisdiction ; before the judgment of conviction was announced that petitioners were willing to go to jail in order to get justice ; and in accusing the court, in its presence and hearing and in that of a large number of persons there assembled, of partiality to the defendant and prejudice against the State. The uncontradicted testimony of the witnesses sustains only three of these findings, viz : ( 1 ) filing the application for a change of venue ; ( 2 ) declining to proceed with the trial ; and ( 3 ) stating that the court was without jurisdiction. This last may properly be considered in connection with the declination to proceed with the trial, because it is shown to have been stated as a reason for not so proceeding. The statute ( Sec. 3881, R. S. 1909 ) so far as its terms are applicable to the facts here, defines a direct contempt to be any disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior committed during the session of the court in its immediate view and presence and directly tending to interrupt its proceeding or to impair the respect due to its authority. Comprehensive as is this defini * 115tion it is not to be construed as a limitation upon the right of the courts to punish for contempt, this power being, as we held in State ex inf. v. Shepherd, 177 Mo. 205, and in Ex parte Crenshaw, 80 Mo. l. c. 453, inherent, is, in the absence of constitutional inhibition, free from the definitive action of the Legislature. In this general declaration as to the power of the courts we are not unmindful of the modification of the rule in the Shepard case in Ex parte Creasy, 243 Mo. 680, 708, which, however, under the facts, does not affect the matter at issue. The manifestations of contempt being as varied as the actions of the human mind ( 6 R. C. L. 491, sec. 4 ), it remains to be determined, regardless of the statute, whether either or all of the three findings sustained by the facts are sufficient to establish the contumacy of the petitioners. A few general observations, although trite, may serve to clear the atmosphere for the concrete consideration of the question. Primarily courts are constituted to settle controversies. The nature of the matter in dispute is immaterial. It may involve the right of that intangible thing we call the State, to punish an offender for an ’ infraction of the law, or the settlement of differences between private individuals. In short, a court is, in a sense, a clearing house for errors. Its purpose is to determine the right conclusion to be reached in a given ease. If the question involved be not controverted, it is not for its consideration. The course pursued, therefore, by counsel in the conduct of a case, if deferential, can constitute no ground of offense. In a somewhat careful review of the authorities we have been unable to find any case in which it is held that the respectful filing of any pleading or motion, which may reasonably be termed pertinent and not in its terms offensive will be regarded as contemptuous. In Johnson v. State, 87 Ark. 45, it is affirmatively ruled that the _ repeated filing of motions suggesting the disqualifications of a judge, if done in a respectful manner, will not, although deemed by the trial court to be for vexation and delay, constitute * 116contempt. A bolding to the contrary would in our opinion tend to limit the right - of counsel to the detriment of ' litigants. If this latitude be denied, the full purpose of a court ’ s creation will cease and the reason for its existence will be at an end. If the power of the courts to thus limit counsel in the courteous presentation of wbat they may deem errors in a case be conceded, a condition of judicial tyranny will be rendered possible, which - will sooner or later make the administration of justice a farce and the impartial attitude of courts a by - word. If tbis conclusion is in accord with reason, then the challenge to the fairness of the judge made by counsel for the State and styled in the record a motion for a change of venue, did not, in itself, constitute such a mark of disrespect or a matter of offense as to merit punishment. Tbe burden of the motion was not to assail the integrity of the court, but that it had prejudged the case. We must look therefore to the manner in which the motion was made to determine if the action of the court can be sustained, for a contempt like a crime, must be measured by the intent with which it is committed. [ People ex rel. v. La Fetra, 171 N. Y. App. Div. 269 ; Wells v. Commonwealth, 21 Graft. ( Va. ) 500 ; Ex parte Biggs, 64 N. C. l. c. 217. ] Counsel asked leave to file the motion, stating the reason therefor, and citing the statute under which it was claimed to be authorized. The court, while questioning, the application of the statute, except when invoked by a defendant, granted the request. Tbe motion was prepared, examined by the court and permitted to be filed. It was then overruled and counsel directed to proceed with the trial. If, up to tbis point, there was any semblance of contempt in the conduct of counsel, the record does not indicate it, nor is it established by the testimony of witnesses present during the entire transaction. Tbe judge himself did not so regard it. Ever alert, as be should be, to preserve the dignity of bis tribunal, be found thus far, at least, no cause for affront ; but, after having examined the motion, which is brief, clear and easy of comprehension, be gave bis assent to its becoming a part of the files and in the orderly course of * 117procedure overruled it. If he had deemed it otherwise than the exercise of a right accorded to counsel under the recognized rules of precedure, he would have refused to permit it to he filed, and if. this had been inadvertently done, he would have ordered it stricken from the files. Familiar, therefore, with all of the facts and circumstances connected with the filing of the motion, the court gave its assent thereto, which it would not have done if the act had been accompanied by an insult of any character. An act which indicates no insult, even to the scrutinizing eye of the court, cannot reasonably be considered subject to censure, much less condign punishment. We must conclude, therefore, not only from the record, the testimony of the witnesses which we have set forth in detail in the statement of facts, and the conduct of the court, that there was neither in the act of counsel nor in the manner in which it was preformed a manifestation of disrespect. We might well conclude here and order the discharge of the petitioners, if the sum of their offending was limited to the alleged improper filing of the application for a change of venue. There are others, however, as we have noted : ( 1 ) declining to proceed with the trial and ( 2 ) denying the court ’ s jurisdiction. They may be considered together, because, under the facts in this case, they are inseparable. In declining to proceed on account of the court ’ s alleged unfairness, the question of its lack of jurisdiction was necessarily involved and hence not inconsistently asserted. We do not understand, and it is not contended, that either of these acts was committed in a contemptuous maner. If so, there is no evidence to sustain such a contention. The affirmative attitude of counsel, as indicated by Mr. Ewing, when directed to proceed with the trial, was to the contrary. He said, in substance, that he had filed the motion for a change of venue in good faith and with as much earnestness as he had ever filed a paper in court. The charge of contempt, therefore, if sustained by either of these findings must consist in the acts themselves. The only tenable ground upon which this contention can be based is that counsels ’ conduct interrupted the pro * 118ceedings of the court and thus hindered the administration of justice. That a refusal of an officer charged with the control of the prosecution of a State case to proceed with a trial, may or may not, under a proper state of facts, constitute ' contempt, we are not. called upon to determine in this case. Counsel here seeking release were not so charged. Their duty as representatives of the Attorney - General acting under the direction of the Governor was to assist the prosecuting attorney. The statute ( Sec. 967, R. S. 1909 ) in relation thereto is definite in its terms and unmistakable in its meaning. Neither upon their own assumption nor under the orders of the court were counsel authorized to exercise any greater prerogative in the absence of the disqualification of the prosecuting attorney. A condition might, of course, arise due to the incapacity of the latter which would render it necessary for the court to direct assisting counsel to assume control of the trial of a case. No such condition existed here. The record affirmativély declares that the prosecuting attorney had declined, no reason being stated, to participate in this prosecution. No such authority is conferred on this official ; and, in the absence of any fact which would have disqualified him, his sworn duty required him to at least participate in, if he did not direct, the proceeding. The statute defining his duties is mandatory. [ Sec. 1007, R. S. 1909. ] The announcement of the court, therefore, that the prosecuting attorney would not prosecute but that assisting counsel would conduct the proceeding conferred no such unqualified controlling power upon the latter in the disposition of the case as to ' render their presence alone necessary to the continuance of the prosecution. Construed otherwise the statute would authorize the Governor to override by his direction the will of the people, whether exercised wisely or not, in their selection of an officer to prosecute offenders against the law. The province of this statute is to afford assistance to the prosecuting attorney, and not to usurp his power. Rightly construed, it is a wise provision ; given unusual scope, it. cannot but prove pernicious in its operation. * 119When, therefore, counsel declined to proceed, the court, conscious of the duty devolving on the prosecuting attorney, could have called him in and directed him to conduct the trial to a conclusion. There is no merit,. therefore, in the claim that the failure or refusal of counsel to proceed with the trial constituted any practical harrier to the court ’ s progress in the discharge of its duties. Following the declination of counsel to proceed and the refusal of the court to grant them time in which to apply to the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition, the court declared their conduct to be contemptuous and despite their repeated asseverations that they had filed the motion and declined to proceed, believing their conduct to be authorized under Section 5198, Revised Statutes 1909, they were fined. Upon their. refusal to pay same they were ordered committed to jail. An unfortunate incident followed the assessment of the punishment of counsel in the remark of the judge that it would be necessary to satisfy him - that the fines were not paid out of the public funds.",8019719," WALKER, P. J. Relief by habeas corpus is invoked by petitioners in this court to effect their discharge from an alleged unauthorized judgment of commitment for contempt rendered against them by the judge of the circuit court of Cole County. The writ was granted as prayed and made returnable on a day certain. The sheriff of Cole County, who held petitioners in custody, made return to the writ, to which petitioners filed their reply. The facts as set out in the judgment of commitment with which the return is in accord, having been put in issue by the reply of petitioners, the court appointed Yirgil Y. Huff, Esq., as a special commissioner, to take testimony concerning the disputed facts and report his findings of fact and conclusions of law in relation thereto. The commissioner having heard the testimony, filed herein a transcript of same, together with his .findings and conclusions in conformity with the order of his appointment. To this report the sheriff filed his formal exceptions. The issue has, been presented in extenso. Counsel for the respective parties have argued the matter orally and have filed printed briefs and arguments herein. The facts out of which this proceeding arose are as follows: In November, 1917, there was pending in the circuit court of Cole County, in which Hon. John G. Slate presides as judge, a criminal case entitled the State v. John W. Scott, in which the defendant was charged with the larceny and embezzlement of coal belonging to the State. The Attorney-General had been directed by the Governor to appear and assist the prosecuting attorney in the trial of this ease. Petitioners, representing the Attorney-General and at his behest, appeared in the circuit court and tendered their service to assist the prosecuting attorney. The latter, refused to par-, *104ticipate in the prosecution, whereupon the court announced that the case would be conducted for the-State by the petitioners. The latter having secured a formal entry permitting the endorsement of the names of certain witnesses on the indictment, announced ready for trial, but requested, in addition, that the State be not restricted in the selection of triers of the fact to the regular panel of jurors, for the reason that during that term of court and a few days prior thereto, a trial panel had been chosen from these jurors, the members of which had sat in the trial and had rendered a verdict of acquittal in a criminal .case charging a like offense, similar in all of its material features to the one then before the court, and against this same defendant. The court overruled petitioners’ suggestion, announcing that the jury was not disqualified for the reason stated by petitioners. Furthermore, the court announced in response to an inquiry of petitioners, that the ruling made during the trial of the former case of like character to that before the court and alsoi against said Scott, in regard to testimony of similar transactions by him at or near the time of the -act charged in the pending indictment, would be adhered to in the trial of this case; and that testimony of this character would not be admitted to show intent or for any other purpose. Petitioners then withdrew their announcement of ready for trial and stated that they desired time to file an application for a change of venue on account of the prejudice of the judge against the State. Upon the petitioners having signed and made oath to said application before the clerk of the court, the judge ordereá it not to be filed until he had read it. After reading it the court granted petitioners leave to file same. This was done and at once overruled by the court. Counsel for defendant then announced ready' for trial. Mr. Ewing, one of the petitioners, then asked for time within which to apply to the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition against the judge, on the ground of a lack of jurisdiction after the filing of the application for a charge of, venue. The court refused to grant *105time for that purpose, his language being, “That will be refused. You must proceed with this case.” To which Mr. Ewing replied: “I decline to proceed on account of the attitude of the judge. ” ■ To which the latter replied: “I permitted you to file this application for a change of venue although I thought it was a frivolous proceeding. If, however, the representatives of the Attorney-General’s office want to parade their ignorance before this court and the attorneys present, I guess , I can stand it, but I want to warn you that I am getting tired of your frivolity and that you won’t tamper any longer with the court,adding: “Proceed with the trial of this case. Either continue, dismiss or go on with the trial. The witnesses are present, the jurors are on hand and the defendant has answered ready and he is entitled to a trial at this time. I want to know what you are going to do?” To which Mr. Ewing said: “You are evidently about to fine us for contempt, but before you do so 1 want to say that we never filed a pleading with greater earnestness than when we filed this application for a change of venue.” The judge, after again ordering them to proceed, said: “In view of the fact that you have filed in this court a motion which, to say the least, is frivolous, and because you refuse as representatives of the Attorney-General’s office to proceed with this case, I will adjudge you guilty of contempt and fine you fifty dollars each, and I want satisfactory proof that these fines are paid out of your own pockets and not .out of the Attorney-General’s contingent fund.” “We decline to jpay the fines,” said Mr. Ewing. “In that event,” said the judge, “you are ordered committed to jail until the fines are paid or you are discharged by due course of law.” Addressing the sheriff, the judge said: “Mr. Richter, take charge of these attorneys.” Mr. Ewing then said to the court: “If it is necessary for somebody to go to jail in order that the State may get justice in this case, I am ready to go.” “Be careful,” said the judge, “or I will fine you again.” Prom time to time during this scene petitioners askecl that the court require the official stenog*106rapher to make a note of the proceedings in the order of their occurrence. The stenographer took a position in front of the court’s bench preparatory to taking notes of the proceeding when the court interrupted him saying: “Never mind about that. This is a matter between the attorneys and the court.” The stenographer thus admonished did not take the notes. The variance between the facts, as disclosed in the testimony and as they appear in the findings of the trial court’s judgment, renders a full transcript of the latter necessary to a correct understanding of the case. Omitting the caption, certificate of the clerk as to the correctness of the transcript of the judgment, and incorporating only the body of the application for a change of venue, the judgment and order of commitment are as follows: “Whereas, Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, duly licensed and practicing attorneys-at-law, were adjudged guilty of contempt of court, and each of them, by the 'circuit court of Cole County, Missouri, for contempt committed in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, by its judgment then and there pronounced, ana entered of record among proceedings of said court on the 27th day of November, 1917, which said judgment was in words and figures as follows: “It is ordered and adjudged by the court that Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, attorneys, practicing in this court, and each of them, be fined $50 for contempt of court committed in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, on the 27th day of November, 1917, while the circuit court of ■ Cole County, State of Missouri, was in regular session and during the sitting of said court for the transaction of business that might lawfully be brought before it for consideration, in this: That the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, did wilfully, knowingly and contemptuously file in this court, for and upon behalf of the State of Missouri in a certain cause lawfully pending in said court, what purported to be an application for a change of venue in said cause, which application for a change *107of venue is in writing and in words and figures as follows: “ ‘Comes now the State of Missouri, plaintiff in the above entitled canse, and files its application herein, and says that the Hon. John G. Slate, judge of this court, is prejudiced in this cause against the State, and that by reason of such prejudice, the said judge, by the terms of section 5198, Revised Statutes 1909, is disqualified and prohibited from sitting as judge of this court upon the trial of this cause. “ ‘Wherefore, the State says this court is disqualified to proceed further in this cause,- than in accordance to the provisions of Section 5201, Revised Statutes 1909, and therefore prays that he make an order accordingly granting the State a change of venue herein.’ “Which said foregoing motion and application for a charge of venue was by the court overruled and denied. “That thereafter and thereupon, and while the case of the State of Missouri v. John Scott was then and there pending before the court, wherein the said John Scott is charged with the crime of embezzlement and grand larceny, and while said Scott was present in person in court, and by counsel, and demanding a trial, within his constitutional rights, upon said charge, and the said Lee B. Ewing was present in court as special counsel for the State of Missouri, and the said S. P. Howell was present in court as Assistant Attorney-General, both of whom were in charge of said cause and prosecuting for and upon behalf of the State of Missouri, and appearing for and in the place and stead of the prosecuting attorney of Cole County, Missouri, in said cause; and the court having then and there inquired of them as to whether or not the State of Missouri was ready for trial in said cause, and that thereupon -the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell In the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, and the regular panel of the petit jury then and there assembled, wilfully and contemptuously refused to make answer, although often requested so to do by the *108court, and the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell did then and there state to the court that the State of Missouri could not have a fair and impartial trial before the court then sitting in said cause, and that said court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine said cause, which said statement was made in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court and the said jurors - then assembled for the trial of said-cause, and the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell then and there refused to proceed further, or to «take any further action in said cause; that thereupon the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell were admonished by the court that they must either answer ready for trial, or ask for a continuance, or take some other proper action in said cause; whereupon the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court and jnry, stated that they refused to do either — answer ready for trial, ask for a continuance, or take any further action in the said cause — and after being fully and duly warned by the court that their refusal to take any action whatsoever in said cause would be treated as wilful contempt by them, and each of them, of the court; the said Ewing and Howell again stated in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court and the jnry, wilfully, knowing-ly and contemptuously, that they were willing to be adjudged in contempt of the court and go to jail in order to get justice in said cause, thereby wilfully, knowingly and contemptuously accusing the court, in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, the jury, and a large number of persons there assembled, of being partial towards the defendant, and unduly prejudiced against the State of Missouri in said cause; and that thereafter the said Ewing and Howell refused to further answer, but wilfully and contemptuously stood mute and refused to take* any action whatever in said cause; that the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell did then and there, in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, by their words, act and gestures, offer and commit wilful *109contempt in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court. “Wherefore, the court doth, by reason of the premises aforesaid, adjudge the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, in wilful contempt of the court and doth assess the ‘punishment of the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell, and each of them, at a fine of $50 and that the said Lee B. Ew'ing and the said S. P. Howell, and each of them, stand committed to the common jail of Cole County, Missouri, until said fines of each of them shall be paid, or until they shall be discharged by due course of law; and whereas the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell, and each of them, doth refuse to pay said fines so assessed against them, it is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said Ewing and the said Howell, and each of them stand committed to the common jail of Cole County, Missouri, until said fines of each of them shall be paid, or until they shall be otherwise discharged by due course of law. “These are, Therefore, to command you, the said sheriff of Cole County, Missouri, forthwith to convey and deliver into the custody of the keeper of the county jail of said county the body of the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, so as aforesaid found guilty of contempt and adudged by the said circuit court to be imprisoned therefor in the county jail until further order of this court, or until they be otherwise discharged by due process of law; and you, the said keeper of the said jail, are hereby required to receive the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, into your custody and them confine in the jail of said county until the further order of this court, or until they be otherwise legally discharged by due process of law; and for so doing this shall be your warrant. ’ ’ *110contempt: of Judgment. I. The judgment herein from which petitioners seek relief relies for its potential force upon a finding of direct contempt alleged to have been committed in the face of the court. It is urged preclusively rather than affirmatively, that the findings of this judgment are conclusive, and that no ulterior inquiry can be made into the facts, the effect of which may be to question its validity; the contention being in brief, as is the general rule, that the judgment imports absolute verity — its face constituting not only a certificate of the legitimacy of its origin but of its present good character. ""While the older authorities in other jurisdictions, from which the textwriters deduce statements of principles, unqualifiedly apply the general rule of immunity from collateral attack to judgments of the character here in question, we hold otherwise. Here one convicted of direct contempt in seeking relief through habeas corpus is not limited to an inquiry as to the convicting court’s jurisdiction, but, if the truth of the findings upon which the judgment is based is denied in the petitioner’s reply to the return, inquiry may be made in regard thereto. To this extent we have, as has been done elsewhere (Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547; Ex parte Fisk, 113 U. S. 715; Ex parte Irvine, 74 Fed. l. c. 959), brushed aside the hard-and-fast rule which theretofore hedged about judgments for direct or criminal contempt rendering them immune from attack; and have authorized an inquiry to test the truth of their findings. [Ex parte Creasy, 243 Mo. l. c. 688, 694.] The wisdom and wholesomeness of this modification of the general rule is supported by reason and justice. There is no appeal or right to a writ of error from a judgment for direct or criminal contempt; no provision having been made therefor by statute, the right does not exist. [In re Clark, 208 Mo. l. c. 146.] Absent the right of appeal no opportunity for a full.review of the proceedings is afforded except by habeas corpus. Resort to the writ of certiorari some*111times employed in other jurisdictions will not afford relief, because, as is not infrequently the case, the proceedings concurrent with and provocative of the judgment for contempt, are not preserved in the record and hence cannot be brought up for review. By invoking the aid. of habeas corpus, however, which is always construed in favor of the liberty of the citizen, an opportunity is afforded in a case of the character here under consideration, to look beyond the commitment and its recitals into the evidence and circumstances upon which the court below acted, and determine therefrom, although jurisdiction of the person' and subject-matter be conceded, whether the court had authority to render the judgment; or generally whether the third essential to the court’s right of action existed. This manner of exercise of the right of supervision and control of inferior tribunals whether it rests in the Constitution or arises out of the common law, as one of the attributes of a .court of superior jurisdiction, is held to be authorized notwithstanding the provisions of the Statute (Sec. 2475, R. S. 1909) prohibiting an inquiry into the legality or justice of any process, judgment, decree or order of any court legally constituted or the justice or propriety of any commitment for contempt made by any court, body or officer and plainly charged in such commitment. It being held that although such commitment may recite the existence of the necessary jurisdictional facts to sustain it, the authority of a court or officer cannot be acquired merely by asserting it or by falsely alleging its existence, and hence the evidence may be inquired into to determine the truth. [Ex parte Creasy, 243 Mo. l. c. 695; Ex parte O’Brien, 127 Mo. l. c. 489.] Elsewhere similar statutes have received a like construction (People ex rel. v. Liscomb, 60 N. Y. 559; People v. Cassels, 5 Hill, 164; Ex parte Duncan, 62 S. W. (Tex.) 758; Ex parte Juneman, 28 Tex. App. l. c. 488.] Yiewed from every vantage the reasons for the exemption of judgments for direct contempt from the ordinary rule of immunity from collateral attack, become more apparent. In other *112proceedings the judge stands indifferent between the parties; the procedure is along a beaten pathway found from experience most promotive of justice; and the judgments resulting therefrom are not only entered under the supervision of the court, but are subject, before becoming conclusive, to the scrutiny and criticism of opposing counsel. Thus rendered, the possibility of their findings incorrectly stating the facts cn which they are based are remote if not impossible. Under such circumstances it is not difficult to account for the origin and permanence in our jurisprudence of the rule ordinarily applicable that the findings of a judgment shall import verity and that its conclusion shall be 'inviolable. The characteristics of such a judgment are entirely different from those which distinguish a judgment for direct contempt. The latter is summary and in a sense ex parte in that the court is the only active factor in its rendition. Whatever part the contemner may have contributed to it was completed before the action of he court commenced. With the announcement of the punishment inflicted the judgment became final except for its formal entry upon the record. When so entered its only resemblance to an ordinary judgment is in its form. The court’s adjudication is a conviction and its commitment in consequence an execution. [Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat (U. S.), l. c. 43.] The judicial poise, therefore, which enables the upright judge to hold the balance of justice evenly and fairly in an ordinary case is difficult to maintain in a proceeding for' direct contempt. This is due more perhaps to the limitations of nature than purpose on the part of the judge. Being human, his impulses and passions are subject to the same influences which actuate other men; and while a contempt of court is, as its words clearly indicate, a manifestation of disrespect towards a tribunal in which justice is administered, the judge in whose presence and hearing the offense is committed maintains indeed the true judicial attitude, if in passing judgment on the offender, he assesses the punishment free from any feeling of personal affront. The *113danger of this not being done constitutes an all-sufficient reason why a court of review should in a case of this character carefully .consider all of the facts leading up to the judgment to determine if justice has been fairly administered and not content itself with the conclusiveness of the face of same as in ordinary cases. A contrary ruling involves, not only in its essence but in its application, the absurd conclusion that the judge, although his fiat determines a question of personal liberty, is incapable of acting intemperately or unwisely, even where he may regard himself, through a mistaken idea of what contempt consists, as personally concerned; or that the courts are surrounded by a sacred aura which precludes inquiry into their actions lest their dignity be lowered, their efficacy lessened or their existence endangered. Fortunately, however, for the rights of the individual — paramount to all else in a free country— form, ceremony and a blind adherence to precedent are no longer, if they ever were, dominating influences in judicial action. Year by year the rulings of courts of last resort exemplify this fact. Techflicalities are being swept away; and precedents are followed if reason supports their application, but not otherwise. What the courts require and, demand in the wise and wholesome administration of justice is that the facts in any given case may be fully known. Justice, it is true, is typified as being blind, but only as indicative of her impartiality. Deafness has never been designated as one of her attributes. Deprived of this sense, the suitors at her shrine would receive but haphazard consideration. For these reasons, therefore, and others not necessary, in a proper conservation of time and space, to be added, we give our unqualified approval to the rule announced in the Creasy (243 Mo. 679) and O’Brien (127 Mo. 477) cases and impliedly endorsed in the Clark case (208 Mo. 121), to the effect that in a proceeding by habeas corpus to secure the release of one from a commitment for a direct contempt, we will look beyond the findings of the judgment where the truth of same as set forth in the *114return is- denied by the contemner, to ascertain the full facts from which the right to the writ may be determined. insufficient Facts. II. The right of review not being confined to the findings of the commitment, let us inquire whether these findings are sufficiently in accord with the facts to sustain the judgment. If not, and the variance is in-a^ver^erL^ R is unexcusable; If wilful, it is worse. A more specific characterization is unnecessary because it is not conceivable, either in this or any other case, that a judge charged with the administration of justice and having a purpose only to preserve the dignity of the court in which he presides, will countenance or even tacitly consent to the making of a falsified record to sustain judicial action. Summarized, the findings upon which the- judgment is based are as follows: filing the.application for a change of venue; declining to proceed with the trial; saying to the court that the State could not have a fair and impartial trial in that tribunal; that the court was without jurisdiction; before the judgment of conviction was announced that petitioners were willing to go to jail in order to get justice; and in accusing the court, in its presence and hearing and in that of a large number of persons there assembled, of partiality to the defendant and prejudice against the State. The uncontradicted testimony of the witnesses sustains only three of these findings, viz: (1) filing the application for a change of venue; (2) declining to proceed with the trial; and (3) stating that the court was without jurisdiction. This last may properly be considered in connection with the declination to proceed with the trial, because it is shown to have been stated as a reason for not so proceeding. The statute (Sec. 3881, R. S. 1909) so far as its terms are applicable to the facts here, defines a direct contempt to be any disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior committed during the session of the court in its immediate view and presence and directly tending to interrupt its proceeding or to impair the respect due to its authority. Comprehensive as is this defini*115tion it is not to be construed as a limitation upon the right of the courts to punish for contempt, this power being, as we held in State ex inf. v. Shepherd, 177 Mo. 205, and in Ex parte Crenshaw, 80 Mo. l. c. 453, inherent, is, in the absence of constitutional inhibition, free from the definitive action of the Legislature. In this general declaration as to the power of the courts we are not unmindful of the modification of the rule in the Shepard case in Ex parte Creasy, 243 Mo. 680, 708, which, however, under the facts, does not affect the matter at issue. The manifestations of contempt being as varied as the actions of the human mind (6 R. C. L. 491, sec. 4), it remains to be determined, regardless of the statute, whether either or all of the three findings sustained by the facts are sufficient to establish the contumacy of the petitioners. A few general observations, although trite, may serve to clear the atmosphere for the concrete consideration of the question. Primarily courts are constituted to settle controversies. The nature of the matter in dispute is immaterial. It may involve the right of that intangible thing we call the State, to punish an offender for an’infraction of the law, or the settlement of differences between private individuals. In short, a court is, in a sense, a clearing house for errors. Its purpose is to determine the right conclusion to be reached in a given ease. If the question involved be not controverted, it is not for its consideration. The course pursued, therefore, by counsel in the conduct of a case, if deferential, can constitute no ground of offense. In a somewhat careful review of the authorities we have been unable to find any case in which it is held that the respectful filing of any pleading or motion, which may reasonably be termed pertinent and not in its terms offensive will be regarded as contemptuous. In Johnson v. State, 87 Ark. 45, it is affirmatively ruled that the _ repeated filing of motions suggesting the disqualifications of a judge, if done in a respectful manner, will not, although deemed by the trial court to be for vexation and delay, constitute *116contempt. A bolding to the contrary would in our opinion tend to limit the right- of counsel to the detriment of' litigants. If this latitude be denied, the full purpose of a court’s creation will cease and the reason for its existence will be at an end. If the power of the courts to thus limit counsel in the courteous presentation of wbat they may deem errors in a case be conceded, a condition of judicial tyranny will be rendered possible, which- will sooner or later make the administration of justice a farce and the impartial attitude of courts a by-word. If tbis conclusion is in accord with reason, then the challenge to the fairness of the judge made by counsel for the State and styled in the record a motion for a change of venue, did not, in itself, constitute such a mark of disrespect or a matter of offense as to merit punishment. Tbe burden of the motion was not to assail the integrity of the court, but that it had prejudged the case. We must look therefore to the manner in which the motion was made to determine if the action of the court can be sustained, for a contempt like a crime, must be measured by the intent with which it is committed. [People ex rel. v. La Fetra, 171 N. Y. App. Div. 269; Wells v. Commonwealth, 21 Graft. (Va.) 500; Ex parte Biggs, 64 N. C. l. c. 217.] Counsel asked leave to file the motion, stating the reason therefor, and citing the statute under which it was claimed to be authorized. The court, while questioning, the application of the statute, except when invoked by a defendant, granted the request. Tbe motion was prepared, examined by the court and permitted to be filed. It was then overruled and counsel directed to proceed with the trial. If, up to tbis point, there was any semblance of contempt in the conduct of counsel, the record does not indicate it, nor is it established by the testimony of witnesses present during the entire transaction. Tbe judge himself did not so regard it. Ever alert, as be should be, to preserve the dignity of bis tribunal, be found thus far, at least, no cause for affront; but, after having examined the motion, which is brief, clear and easy of comprehension, be gave bis assent to its becoming a part of the files and in the orderly course of *117procedure overruled it. If he had deemed it otherwise than the exercise of a right accorded to counsel under the recognized rules of precedure, he would have refused to permit it to he filed, and if. this had been inadvertently done, he would have ordered it stricken from the files. Familiar, therefore, with all of the facts and circumstances connected with the filing of the motion, the court gave its assent thereto, which it would not have done if the act had been accompanied by an insult of any character. An act which indicates no insult, even to the scrutinizing eye of the court, cannot reasonably be considered subject to censure, much less condign punishment. We must conclude, therefore, not only from the record, the testimony of the witnesses which we have set forth in detail in the statement of facts, and the conduct of the court, that there was neither in the act of counsel nor in the manner in which it was preformed a manifestation of disrespect. We might well conclude here and order the discharge of the petitioners, if the sum of their offending was limited to the alleged improper filing of the application for a change of venue. There are others, however, as we have noted: (1) declining to proceed with the trial and (2) denying the court’s jurisdiction. They may be considered together, because, under the facts in this case, they are inseparable. In declining to proceed on account of the court’s alleged unfairness, the question of its lack of jurisdiction was necessarily involved and hence not inconsistently asserted. We do not understand, and it is not contended, that either of these acts was committed in a contemptuous maner. If so, there is no evidence to sustain such a contention. The affirmative attitude of counsel, as indicated by Mr. Ewing, when directed to proceed with the trial, was to the contrary. He said, in substance, that he had filed the motion for a change of venue in good faith and with as much earnestness as he had ever filed a paper in court. The charge of contempt, therefore, if sustained by either of these findings must consist in the acts themselves. The only tenable ground upon which this contention can be based is that counsels’ conduct interrupted the pro*118ceedings of the court and thus hindered the administration of justice. That a refusal of an officer charged with the control of the prosecution of a State case to proceed with a trial, may or may not, under a proper state of facts, constitute' contempt, we are not .called upon to determine in this case. Counsel here seeking release were not so charged. Their duty as representatives of the Attorney-General acting under the direction of the Governor was to assist the prosecuting attorney. The statute (Sec. 967, R. S. 1909) in relation thereto is definite in its terms and unmistakable in its meaning. Neither upon their own assumption nor under the orders of the court were counsel authorized to exercise any greater prerogative in the absence of the disqualification of the prosecuting attorney. A condition might, of course, arise due to the incapacity of the latter which would render it necessary for the court to direct assisting counsel to assume control of the trial of a case. No such condition existed here. The record affirmativély declares that the prosecuting attorney had declined, no reason being stated, to participate in this prosecution. No such authority is conferred on this official; and, in the absence of any fact which would have disqualified him, his sworn duty required him to at least participate in, if he did not direct, the proceeding. The statute defining his duties is mandatory. [Sec. 1007, R. S. 1909.] The announcement of the court, therefore, that the prosecuting attorney would not prosecute but that assisting counsel would conduct the proceeding conferred no such unqualified controlling power upon the latter in the disposition of the case as to' render their presence alone necessary to the continuance of the prosecution. Construed otherwise the statute would authorize the Governor to override by his direction the will of the people, whether exercised wisely or not, in their selection of an officer to prosecute offenders against the law. The province of this statute is to afford assistance to the prosecuting attorney, and not to usurp his power. Rightly construed, it is a wise provision; given unusual scope, it. cannot but prove pernicious in its operation. *119When, therefore, counsel declined to proceed, the court, conscious of the duty devolving on the prosecuting attorney, could have called him in and directed him to conduct the trial to a conclusion. There is no merit,. therefore, in the claim that the failure or refusal of counsel to proceed with the trial constituted any practical harrier to the court’s progress in the discharge of its duties. Following the declination of counsel to proceed and the refusal of the court to grant them time in which to apply to the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition, the court declared their conduct to be contemptuous and despite their repeated asseverations that they had filed the motion and declined to proceed, believing their conduct to be authorized under Section 5198, Revised Statutes 1909, they were fined. Upon their .refusal to pay same they were ordered committed to jail. An unfortunate incident followed the assessment of the punishment of counsel in the remark of the judge that it would be necessary to satisfy him-that the fines were not paid out of the public funds. We refer -to this reluctantly, only to say that the remark did not constitute an illuminating illustration of that cool judicial equipoise which should characterize the conduct of a judge assessing punishment against counsel for an infraction of the court’s dignity. 5198 0n III. Holding as we do that the acts of counsel were neither in themselves nor on account of the demeanor which characterized their commission, contemptuous, it is not necessary to determine whether the mo^on which constituted a challenge to the fairness of the court was authorized under that subdivision of Section 5198, Revised statutes 1909, which provides that a judge shall be incompetent to hear and try a case when in anywise interested or prejudiced. The origin and history of this section has been chronologically presented in the briefs, where it may be readily examined, and it is, therefore, unnecessary to set it out *120herein. It will be time enough to construe the statute when confronted with that duty. TV. Whatever may be said in the above behalf, however, since it does not constitute a( ruling necessary to the determination of the case, may properly be regarded as the personal observations of the writer. The application of the statute other than when invoked by a defendant, although that seems to have been its usual construction, is not unreasonable. A condition of the public mind may exist in a locality which would impel a public prosecutor, in an honest effort to discharge his duty, to at least call the trial judge’s attention to circumstances indicating that he had, although without corrupt intent, prejudged the case and that it should be tried by another. This would involve no question of personal integrity, afford at least a fair opportunity for tthe State to conduct the prosecution free from any possible ulterior influence, and in no wise interfere with any right accorded to the defendant. Let us suppose, although the illustration may be remote, a condition of the public mind where the doctrine of meum and tuum, so far as it applies to the sacredness of public property, has come to be lightly regarded, and while a proper sensitiveness as to the rights of private individuals may prevail, as to the rights of the public, “the good old rule sufficeth them, the simple plan, that they should take who have the power and they should keep who can.” Where this standard of right prevails its influence may possibly extend to a greater or less degree to the instrumentalities employed in the administration of justice. Judges themselves, although unconscious of same,""may be subject to this influence. Where it exists justice cannot be fairly administered by those subject thereto. The remedy is simple. Upon the suggestion of prejudice being made under Section 5198, the judge, prompted by that sense of delicacy and duty which renders him averse to judicial action upon an intimation of his interest in the matter at issue, will retire and call in another to try the case. Section 5201, Re*121vised Statutes 1909, reasonably construed, will authorize this course. Such a course' would indicate a high sense of official duty, as well as a dispassionate purpose on the part of the judge, to free the case from even an intimation that he could not fairly conduct it. The reasoning of this court in awarding a writ of prohibition against a circuit judge in State ex rel. v. Wear, 129 Mo. 619, gives favorable color to the correctness of the foregoing conclusion. While the facts in that case are somewhat different from those in the case at bar, the construction given to Section 5198 (then Section 4174) is strongly persuasive of what constitutes a proper application of that section. In the Wear ease the ground of disqualification which the judge himself had recognized, was relationship to the accused. The judge, recognizing this relationship and its consequent disqualifying effect, had called in a judge from an adjoining circuit, hut when he appeared to try the case Judge Wear refused to surrender the court room to him or otherwise permit him to proceed. Thereupon the prosecuting attorney of the county where the case was pending applied for and was granted a writ, of prohibition. This court in granting the writ cited the Constitution (Sec. 29, Art. 6), which provides in the event of a vacancy in the office of a judge or his inability for any cause to hold a term or part of a term, the same may be held by a judge of any other circuit; and at the request of a judge of any circuit, any term or part of a term, in the circuit of the judge unable to hold the court, may he held by the judge of any other circuit. The Legislature is authorized to make such provisions for the holding of court as is found necessary. “In obedience to this command of the Constitution” says the court, “the Legislature enacted Section 4174, Revised Statutes 1889.” The section is then set forth in full and is identical in its terms with what is now Section 5198. As a method to render this section operative, Section 4178, Revised Statutes 1889 (now Section 5201), was enacted which provides how and under what circumstances, when the incompetency of a judge *122is alleged, another may be called in. In discussing these constitutional and statutory provisions the court said: “It is plain that Judge ""Wear by his relation to his son, the defendant, was disqualified, and knowing this, it was his imperative duty to either order the election of a special judge or to call in the judge of another circuit to sit in the trial of the said indictment.” As a logical conclusion flowing from this reasoning it would seem that the duty of the judge, whose right to sit was challenged, would be equally imperative, regardless of the ground of disqualification urged if within the terms of the statute. For the reasons stated, we are of the opinion that the judgment against the petitioners should be set aside and that they should be discharged. It is so ordered.

Relief by habeas corpus is invoked by petitioners in this court to effect their discharge from an alleged unauthorized judgment of commitment for contempt rendered against them by the judge of the circuit court of Cole County. The writ was granted as prayed and made returnable on a day certain. The sheriff of Cole County, who held petitioners in custody, made return to the writ, to which petitioners filed their reply. The facts as set out in the judgment of commitment with which the return is in accord, having been put in issue by the reply of petitioners, the court appointed Yirgil Y. Huff, Esq., as a special commissioner, to take testimony concerning the disputed facts and report his findings of fact and conclusions of law in relation thereto. The commissioner having heard the testimony, filed herein a transcript of same, together with his .findings and conclusions in conformity with the order of his appointment. To this report the sheriff filed his formal exceptions. The issue has, been presented in extenso. Counsel for the respective parties have argued the matter orally and have filed printed briefs and arguments herein. The facts out of which this proceeding arose are as follows: In November, 1917, there was pending in the circuit court of Cole County, in which Hon. John G. Slate presides as judge, a criminal case entitled the State v. John W. Scott, in which the defendant was charged with the larceny and embezzlement of coal belonging to the State. The Attorney-General had been directed by the Governor to appear and assist the prosecuting attorney in the trial of this ease. Petitioners, representing the Attorney-General and at his behest, appeared in the circuit court and tendered their service to assist the prosecuting attorney. The latter, refused to par-, *104ticipate in the prosecution, whereupon the court announced that the case would be conducted for the-State by the petitioners. The latter having secured a formal entry permitting the endorsement of the names of certain witnesses on the indictment, announced ready for trial, but requested, in addition, that the State be not restricted in the selection of triers of the fact to the regular panel of jurors, for the reason that during that term of court and a few days prior thereto, a trial panel had been chosen from these jurors, the members of which had sat in the trial and had rendered a verdict of acquittal in a criminal .case charging a like offense, similar in all of its material features to the one then before the court, and against this same defendant. The court overruled petitioners’ suggestion, announcing that the jury was not disqualified for the reason stated by petitioners. Furthermore, the court announced in response to an inquiry of petitioners, that the ruling made during the trial of the former case of like character to that before the court and alsoi against said Scott, in regard to testimony of similar transactions by him at or near the time of the -act charged in the pending indictment, would be adhered to in the trial of this case; and that testimony of this character would not be admitted to show intent or for any other purpose. Petitioners then withdrew their announcement of ready for trial and stated that they desired time to file an application for a change of venue on account of the prejudice of the judge against the State. Upon the petitioners having signed and made oath to said application before the clerk of the court, the judge ordereá it not to be filed until he had read it. After reading it the court granted petitioners leave to file same. This was done and at once overruled by the court. Counsel for defendant then announced ready' for trial. Mr. Ewing, one of the petitioners, then asked for time within which to apply to the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition against the judge, on the ground of a lack of jurisdiction after the filing of the application for a charge of, venue. The court refused to grant *105time for that purpose, his language being, “That will be refused. You must proceed with this case.” To which Mr. Ewing replied: “I decline to proceed on account of the attitude of the judge. ” ■ To which the latter replied: “I permitted you to file this application for a change of venue although I thought it was a frivolous proceeding. If, however, the representatives of the Attorney-General’s office want to parade their ignorance before this court and the attorneys present, I guess , I can stand it, but I want to warn you that I am getting tired of your frivolity and that you won’t tamper any longer with the court,adding: “Proceed with the trial of this case. Either continue, dismiss or go on with the trial. The witnesses are present, the jurors are on hand and the defendant has answered ready and he is entitled to a trial at this time. I want to know what you are going to do?” To which Mr. Ewing said: “You are evidently about to fine us for contempt, but before you do so 1 want to say that we never filed a pleading with greater earnestness than when we filed this application for a change of venue.” The judge, after again ordering them to proceed, said: “In view of the fact that you have filed in this court a motion which, to say the least, is frivolous, and because you refuse as representatives of the Attorney-General’s office to proceed with this case, I will adjudge you guilty of contempt and fine you fifty dollars each, and I want satisfactory proof that these fines are paid out of your own pockets and not .out of the Attorney-General’s contingent fund.” “We decline to jpay the fines,” said Mr. Ewing. “In that event,” said the judge, “you are ordered committed to jail until the fines are paid or you are discharged by due course of law.” Addressing the sheriff, the judge said: “Mr. Richter, take charge of these attorneys.” Mr. Ewing then said to the court: “If it is necessary for somebody to go to jail in order that the State may get justice in this case, I am ready to go.” “Be careful,” said the judge, “or I will fine you again.” Prom time to time during this scene petitioners askecl that the court require the official stenog*106rapher to make a note of the proceedings in the order of their occurrence. The stenographer took a position in front of the court’s bench preparatory to taking notes of the proceeding when the court interrupted him saying: “Never mind about that. This is a matter between the attorneys and the court.” The stenographer thus admonished did not take the notes. The variance between the facts, as disclosed in the testimony and as they appear in the findings of the trial court’s judgment, renders a full transcript of the latter necessary to a correct understanding of the case. Omitting the caption, certificate of the clerk as to the correctness of the transcript of the judgment, and incorporating only the body of the application for a change of venue, the judgment and order of commitment are as follows: “Whereas, Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, duly licensed and practicing attorneys-at-law, were adjudged guilty of contempt of court, and each of them, by the 'circuit court of Cole County, Missouri, for contempt committed in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, by its judgment then and there pronounced, ana entered of record among proceedings of said court on the 27th day of November, 1917, which said judgment was in words and figures as follows: “It is ordered and adjudged by the court that Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, attorneys, practicing in this court, and each of them, be fined $50 for contempt of court committed in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, on the 27th day of November, 1917, while the circuit court of ■ Cole County, State of Missouri, was in regular session and during the sitting of said court for the transaction of business that might lawfully be brought before it for consideration, in this: That the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, did wilfully, knowingly and contemptuously file in this court, for and upon behalf of the State of Missouri in a certain cause lawfully pending in said court, what purported to be an application for a change of venue in said cause, which application for a change *107of venue is in writing and in words and figures as follows: “ ‘Comes now the State of Missouri, plaintiff in the above entitled canse, and files its application herein, and says that the Hon. John G. Slate, judge of this court, is prejudiced in this cause against the State, and that by reason of such prejudice, the said judge, by the terms of section 5198, Revised Statutes 1909, is disqualified and prohibited from sitting as judge of this court upon the trial of this cause. “ ‘Wherefore, the State says this court is disqualified to proceed further in this cause,- than in accordance to the provisions of Section 5201, Revised Statutes 1909, and therefore prays that he make an order accordingly granting the State a change of venue herein.’ “Which said foregoing motion and application for a charge of venue was by the court overruled and denied. “That thereafter and thereupon, and while the case of the State of Missouri v. John Scott was then and there pending before the court, wherein the said John Scott is charged with the crime of embezzlement and grand larceny, and while said Scott was present in person in court, and by counsel, and demanding a trial, within his constitutional rights, upon said charge, and the said Lee B. Ewing was present in court as special counsel for the State of Missouri, and the said S. P. Howell was present in court as Assistant Attorney-General, both of whom were in charge of said cause and prosecuting for and upon behalf of the State of Missouri, and appearing for and in the place and stead of the prosecuting attorney of Cole County, Missouri, in said cause; and the court having then and there inquired of them as to whether or not the State of Missouri was ready for trial in said cause, and that thereupon -the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell In the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, and the regular panel of the petit jury then and there assembled, wilfully and contemptuously refused to make answer, although often requested so to do by the *108court, and the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell did then and there state to the court that the State of Missouri could not have a fair and impartial trial before the court then sitting in said cause, and that said court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine said cause, which said statement was made in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court and the said jurors - then assembled for the trial of said-cause, and the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell then and there refused to proceed further, or to «take any further action in said cause; that thereupon the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell were admonished by the court that they must either answer ready for trial, or ask for a continuance, or take some other proper action in said cause; whereupon the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court and jnry, stated that they refused to do either — answer ready for trial, ask for a continuance, or take any further action in the said cause — and after being fully and duly warned by the court that their refusal to take any action whatsoever in said cause would be treated as wilful contempt by them, and each of them, of the court; the said Ewing and Howell again stated in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court and the jnry, wilfully, knowing-ly and contemptuously, that they were willing to be adjudged in contempt of the court and go to jail in order to get justice in said cause, thereby wilfully, knowingly and contemptuously accusing the court, in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, the jury, and a large number of persons there assembled, of being partial towards the defendant, and unduly prejudiced against the State of Missouri in said cause; and that thereafter the said Ewing and Howell refused to further answer, but wilfully and contemptuously stood mute and refused to take* any action whatever in said cause; that the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell did then and there, in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court, by their words, act and gestures, offer and commit wilful *109contempt in the immediate view, presence and hearing of the court. “Wherefore, the court doth, by reason of the premises aforesaid, adjudge the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, in wilful contempt of the court and doth assess the ‘punishment of the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell, and each of them, at a fine of $50 and that the said Lee B. Ew'ing and the said S. P. Howell, and each of them, stand committed to the common jail of Cole County, Missouri, until said fines of each of them shall be paid, or until they shall be discharged by due course of law; and whereas the said Lee B. Ewing and the said S. P. Howell, and each of them, doth refuse to pay said fines so assessed against them, it is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said Ewing and the said Howell, and each of them stand committed to the common jail of Cole County, Missouri, until said fines of each of them shall be paid, or until they shall be otherwise discharged by due course of law. “These are, Therefore, to command you, the said sheriff of Cole County, Missouri, forthwith to convey and deliver into the custody of the keeper of the county jail of said county the body of the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, so as aforesaid found guilty of contempt and adudged by the said circuit court to be imprisoned therefor in the county jail until further order of this court, or until they be otherwise discharged by due process of law; and you, the said keeper of the said jail, are hereby required to receive the said Lee B. Ewing and S. P. Howell, and each of them, into your custody and them confine in the jail of said county until the further order of this court, or until they be otherwise legally discharged by due process of law; and for so doing this shall be your warrant. ’ ’ *110contempt: of Judgment. I. The judgment herein from which petitioners seek relief relies for its potential force upon a finding of direct contempt alleged to have been committed in the face of the court. It is urged preclusively rather than affirmatively, that the findings of this judgment are conclusive, and that no ulterior inquiry can be made into the facts, the effect of which may be to question its validity; the contention being in brief, as is the general rule, that the judgment imports absolute verity — its face constituting not only a certificate of the legitimacy of its origin but of its present good character. ""While the older authorities in other jurisdictions, from which the textwriters deduce statements of principles, unqualifiedly apply the general rule of immunity from collateral attack to judgments of the character here in question, we hold otherwise. Here one convicted of direct contempt in seeking relief through habeas corpus is not limited to an inquiry as to the convicting court’s jurisdiction, but, if the truth of the findings upon which the judgment is based is denied in the petitioner’s reply to the return, inquiry may be made in regard thereto. To this extent we have, as has been done elsewhere (Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547; Ex parte Fisk, 113 U. S. 715; Ex parte Irvine, 74 Fed. l. c. 959), brushed aside the hard-and-fast rule which theretofore hedged about judgments for direct or criminal contempt rendering them immune from attack; and have authorized an inquiry to test the truth of their findings. [Ex parte Creasy, 243 Mo. l. c. 688, 694.] The wisdom and wholesomeness of this modification of the general rule is supported by reason and justice. There is no appeal or right to a writ of error from a judgment for direct or criminal contempt; no provision having been made therefor by statute, the right does not exist. [In re Clark, 208 Mo. l. c. 146.] Absent the right of appeal no opportunity for a full.review of the proceedings is afforded except by habeas corpus. Resort to the writ of certiorari some*111times employed in other jurisdictions will not afford relief, because, as is not infrequently the case, the proceedings concurrent with and provocative of the judgment for contempt, are not preserved in the record and hence cannot be brought up for review. By invoking the aid. of habeas corpus, however, which is always construed in favor of the liberty of the citizen, an opportunity is afforded in a case of the character here under consideration, to look beyond the commitment and its recitals into the evidence and circumstances upon which the court below acted, and determine therefrom, although jurisdiction of the person' and subject-matter be conceded, whether the court had authority to render the judgment; or generally whether the third essential to the court’s right of action existed. This manner of exercise of the right of supervision and control of inferior tribunals whether it rests in the Constitution or arises out of the common law, as one of the attributes of a .court of superior jurisdiction, is held to be authorized notwithstanding the provisions of the Statute (Sec. 2475, R. S. 1909) prohibiting an inquiry into the legality or justice of any process, judgment, decree or order of any court legally constituted or the justice or propriety of any commitment for contempt made by any court, body or officer and plainly charged in such commitment. It being held that although such commitment may recite the existence of the necessary jurisdictional facts to sustain it, the authority of a court or officer cannot be acquired merely by asserting it or by falsely alleging its existence, and hence the evidence may be inquired into to determine the truth. [Ex parte Creasy, 243 Mo. l. c. 695; Ex parte O’Brien, 127 Mo. l. c. 489.] Elsewhere similar statutes have received a like construction (People ex rel. v. Liscomb, 60 N. Y. 559; People v. Cassels, 5 Hill, 164; Ex parte Duncan, 62 S. W. (Tex.) 758; Ex parte Juneman, 28 Tex. App. l. c. 488.] Yiewed from every vantage the reasons for the exemption of judgments for direct contempt from the ordinary rule of immunity from collateral attack, become more apparent. In other *112proceedings the judge stands indifferent between the parties; the procedure is along a beaten pathway found from experience most promotive of justice; and the judgments resulting therefrom are not only entered under the supervision of the court, but are subject, before becoming conclusive, to the scrutiny and criticism of opposing counsel. Thus rendered, the possibility of their findings incorrectly stating the facts cn which they are based are remote if not impossible. Under such circumstances it is not difficult to account for the origin and permanence in our jurisprudence of the rule ordinarily applicable that the findings of a judgment shall import verity and that its conclusion shall be 'inviolable. The characteristics of such a judgment are entirely different from those which distinguish a judgment for direct contempt. The latter is summary and in a sense ex parte in that the court is the only active factor in its rendition. Whatever part the contemner may have contributed to it was completed before the action of he court commenced. With the announcement of the punishment inflicted the judgment became final except for its formal entry upon the record. When so entered its only resemblance to an ordinary judgment is in its form. The court’s adjudication is a conviction and its commitment in consequence an execution. [Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat (U. S.), l. c. 43.] The judicial poise, therefore, which enables the upright judge to hold the balance of justice evenly and fairly in an ordinary case is difficult to maintain in a proceeding for' direct contempt. This is due more perhaps to the limitations of nature than purpose on the part of the judge. Being human, his impulses and passions are subject to the same influences which actuate other men; and while a contempt of court is, as its words clearly indicate, a manifestation of disrespect towards a tribunal in which justice is administered, the judge in whose presence and hearing the offense is committed maintains indeed the true judicial attitude, if in passing judgment on the offender, he assesses the punishment free from any feeling of personal affront. The *113danger of this not being done constitutes an all-sufficient reason why a court of review should in a case of this character carefully .consider all of the facts leading up to the judgment to determine if justice has been fairly administered and not content itself with the conclusiveness of the face of same as in ordinary cases. A contrary ruling involves, not only in its essence but in its application, the absurd conclusion that the judge, although his fiat determines a question of personal liberty, is incapable of acting intemperately or unwisely, even where he may regard himself, through a mistaken idea of what contempt consists, as personally concerned; or that the courts are surrounded by a sacred aura which precludes inquiry into their actions lest their dignity be lowered, their efficacy lessened or their existence endangered. Fortunately, however, for the rights of the individual — paramount to all else in a free country— form, ceremony and a blind adherence to precedent are no longer, if they ever were, dominating influences in judicial action. Year by year the rulings of courts of last resort exemplify this fact. Techflicalities are being swept away; and precedents are followed if reason supports their application, but not otherwise. What the courts require and, demand in the wise and wholesome administration of justice is that the facts in any given case may be fully known. Justice, it is true, is typified as being blind, but only as indicative of her impartiality. Deafness has never been designated as one of her attributes. Deprived of this sense, the suitors at her shrine would receive but haphazard consideration. For these reasons, therefore, and others not necessary, in a proper conservation of time and space, to be added, we give our unqualified approval to the rule announced in the Creasy (243 Mo. 679) and O’Brien (127 Mo. 477) cases and impliedly endorsed in the Clark case (208 Mo. 121), to the effect that in a proceeding by habeas corpus to secure the release of one from a commitment for a direct contempt, we will look beyond the findings of the judgment where the truth of same as set forth in the *114return is- denied by the contemner, to ascertain the full facts from which the right to the writ may be determined. insufficient Facts. II. The right of review not being confined to the findings of the commitment, let us inquire whether these findings are sufficiently in accord with the facts to sustain the judgment. If not, and the variance is in-a^ver^erL^ R is unexcusable; If wilful, it is worse. A more specific characterization is unnecessary because it is not conceivable, either in this or any other case, that a judge charged with the administration of justice and having a purpose only to preserve the dignity of the court in which he presides, will countenance or even tacitly consent to the making of a falsified record to sustain judicial action. Summarized, the findings upon which the- judgment is based are as follows: filing the.application for a change of venue; declining to proceed with the trial; saying to the court that the State could not have a fair and impartial trial in that tribunal; that the court was without jurisdiction; before the judgment of conviction was announced that petitioners were willing to go to jail in order to get justice; and in accusing the court, in its presence and hearing and in that of a large number of persons there assembled, of partiality to the defendant and prejudice against the State. The uncontradicted testimony of the witnesses sustains only three of these findings, viz: (1) filing the application for a change of venue; (2) declining to proceed with the trial; and (3) stating that the court was without jurisdiction. This last may properly be considered in connection with the declination to proceed with the trial, because it is shown to have been stated as a reason for not so proceeding. The statute (Sec. 3881, R. S. 1909) so far as its terms are applicable to the facts here, defines a direct contempt to be any disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior committed during the session of the court in its immediate view and presence and directly tending to interrupt its proceeding or to impair the respect due to its authority. Comprehensive as is this defini*115tion it is not to be construed as a limitation upon the right of the courts to punish for contempt, this power being, as we held in State ex inf. v. Shepherd, 177 Mo. 205, and in Ex parte Crenshaw, 80 Mo. l. c. 453, inherent, is, in the absence of constitutional inhibition, free from the definitive action of the Legislature. In this general declaration as to the power of the courts we are not unmindful of the modification of the rule in the Shepard case in Ex parte Creasy, 243 Mo. 680, 708, which, however, under the facts, does not affect the matter at issue. The manifestations of contempt being as varied as the actions of the human mind (6 R. C. L. 491, sec. 4), it remains to be determined, regardless of the statute, whether either or all of the three findings sustained by the facts are sufficient to establish the contumacy of the petitioners. A few general observations, although trite, may serve to clear the atmosphere for the concrete consideration of the question. Primarily courts are constituted to settle controversies. The nature of the matter in dispute is immaterial. It may involve the right of that intangible thing we call the State, to punish an offender for an’infraction of the law, or the settlement of differences between private individuals. In short, a court is, in a sense, a clearing house for errors. Its purpose is to determine the right conclusion to be reached in a given ease. If the question involved be not controverted, it is not for its consideration. The course pursued, therefore, by counsel in the conduct of a case, if deferential, can constitute no ground of offense. In a somewhat careful review of the authorities we have been unable to find any case in which it is held that the respectful filing of any pleading or motion, which may reasonably be termed pertinent and not in its terms offensive will be regarded as contemptuous. In Johnson v. State, 87 Ark. 45, it is affirmatively ruled that the _ repeated filing of motions suggesting the disqualifications of a judge, if done in a respectful manner, will not, although deemed by the trial court to be for vexation and delay, constitute *116contempt. A bolding to the contrary would in our opinion tend to limit the right- of counsel to the detriment of' litigants. If this latitude be denied, the full purpose of a court’s creation will cease and the reason for its existence will be at an end. If the power of the courts to thus limit counsel in the courteous presentation of wbat they may deem errors in a case be conceded, a condition of judicial tyranny will be rendered possible, which- will sooner or later make the administration of justice a farce and the impartial attitude of courts a by-word. If tbis conclusion is in accord with reason, then the challenge to the fairness of the judge made by counsel for the State and styled in the record a motion for a change of venue, did not, in itself, constitute such a mark of disrespect or a matter of offense as to merit punishment. Tbe burden of the motion was not to assail the integrity of the court, but that it had prejudged the case. We must look therefore to the manner in which the motion was made to determine if the action of the court can be sustained, for a contempt like a crime, must be measured by the intent with which it is committed. [People ex rel. v. La Fetra, 171 N. Y. App. Div. 269; Wells v. Commonwealth, 21 Graft. (Va.) 500; Ex parte Biggs, 64 N. C. l. c. 217.] Counsel asked leave to file the motion, stating the reason therefor, and citing the statute under which it was claimed to be authorized. The court, while questioning, the application of the statute, except when invoked by a defendant, granted the request. Tbe motion was prepared, examined by the court and permitted to be filed. It was then overruled and counsel directed to proceed with the trial. If, up to tbis point, there was any semblance of contempt in the conduct of counsel, the record does not indicate it, nor is it established by the testimony of witnesses present during the entire transaction. Tbe judge himself did not so regard it. Ever alert, as be should be, to preserve the dignity of bis tribunal, be found thus far, at least, no cause for affront; but, after having examined the motion, which is brief, clear and easy of comprehension, be gave bis assent to its becoming a part of the files and in the orderly course of *117procedure overruled it. If he had deemed it otherwise than the exercise of a right accorded to counsel under the recognized rules of precedure, he would have refused to permit it to he filed, and if. this had been inadvertently done, he would have ordered it stricken from the files. Familiar, therefore, with all of the facts and circumstances connected with the filing of the motion, the court gave its assent thereto, which it would not have done if the act had been accompanied by an insult of any character. An act which indicates no insult, even to the scrutinizing eye of the court, cannot reasonably be considered subject to censure, much less condign punishment. We must conclude, therefore, not only from the record, the testimony of the witnesses which we have set forth in detail in the statement of facts, and the conduct of the court, that there was neither in the act of counsel nor in the manner in which it was preformed a manifestation of disrespect. We might well conclude here and order the discharge of the petitioners, if the sum of their offending was limited to the alleged improper filing of the application for a change of venue. There are others, however, as we have noted: (1) declining to proceed with the trial and (2) denying the court’s jurisdiction. They may be considered together, because, under the facts in this case, they are inseparable. In declining to proceed on account of the court’s alleged unfairness, the question of its lack of jurisdiction was necessarily involved and hence not inconsistently asserted. We do not understand, and it is not contended, that either of these acts was committed in a contemptuous maner. If so, there is no evidence to sustain such a contention. The affirmative attitude of counsel, as indicated by Mr. Ewing, when directed to proceed with the trial, was to the contrary. He said, in substance, that he had filed the motion for a change of venue in good faith and with as much earnestness as he had ever filed a paper in court. The charge of contempt, therefore, if sustained by either of these findings must consist in the acts themselves. The only tenable ground upon which this contention can be based is that counsels’ conduct interrupted the pro*118ceedings of the court and thus hindered the administration of justice. That a refusal of an officer charged with the control of the prosecution of a State case to proceed with a trial, may or may not, under a proper state of facts, constitute' contempt, we are not .called upon to determine in this case. Counsel here seeking release were not so charged. Their duty as representatives of the Attorney-General acting under the direction of the Governor was to assist the prosecuting attorney. The statute (Sec. 967, R. S. 1909) in relation thereto is definite in its terms and unmistakable in its meaning. Neither upon their own assumption nor under the orders of the court were counsel authorized to exercise any greater prerogative in the absence of the disqualification of the prosecuting attorney. A condition might, of course, arise due to the incapacity of the latter which would render it necessary for the court to direct assisting counsel to assume control of the trial of a case. No such condition existed here. The record affirmativély declares that the prosecuting attorney had declined, no reason being stated, to participate in this prosecution. No such authority is conferred on this official; and, in the absence of any fact which would have disqualified him, his sworn duty required him to at least participate in, if he did not direct, the proceeding. The statute defining his duties is mandatory. [Sec. 1007, R. S. 1909.] The announcement of the court, therefore, that the prosecuting attorney would not prosecute but that assisting counsel would conduct the proceeding conferred no such unqualified controlling power upon the latter in the disposition of the case as to' render their presence alone necessary to the continuance of the prosecution. Construed otherwise the statute would authorize the Governor to override by his direction the will of the people, whether exercised wisely or not, in their selection of an officer to prosecute offenders against the law. The province of this statute is to afford assistance to the prosecuting attorney, and not to usurp his power. Rightly construed, it is a wise provision; given unusual scope, it. cannot but prove pernicious in its operation. *119When, therefore, counsel declined to proceed, the court, conscious of the duty devolving on the prosecuting attorney, could have called him in and directed him to conduct the trial to a conclusion. There is no merit,. therefore, in the claim that the failure or refusal of counsel to proceed with the trial constituted any practical harrier to the court’s progress in the discharge of its duties. Following the declination of counsel to proceed and the refusal of the court to grant them time in which to apply to the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition, the court declared their conduct to be contemptuous and despite their repeated asseverations that they had filed the motion and declined to proceed, believing their conduct to be authorized under Section 5198, Revised Statutes 1909, they were fined. Upon their .refusal to pay same they were ordered committed to jail. An unfortunate incident followed the assessment of the punishment of counsel in the remark of the judge that it would be necessary to satisfy him-that the fines were not paid out of the public funds. We refer -to this reluctantly, only to say that the remark did not constitute an illuminating illustration of that cool judicial equipoise which should characterize the conduct of a judge assessing punishment against counsel for an infraction of the court’s dignity. 5198 0n III. Holding as we do that the acts of counsel were neither in themselves nor on account of the demeanor which characterized their commission, contemptuous, it is not necessary to determine whether the mo^on which constituted a challenge to the fairness of the court was authorized under that subdivision of Section 5198, Revised statutes 1909, which provides that a judge shall be incompetent to hear and try a case when in anywise interested or prejudiced. The origin and history of this section has been chronologically presented in the briefs, where it may be readily examined, and it is, therefore, unnecessary to set it out *120herein. It will be time enough to construe the statute when confronted with that duty. TV. Whatever may be said in the above behalf, however, since it does not constitute a( ruling necessary to the determination of the case, may properly be regarded as the personal observations of the writer. The application of the statute other than when invoked by a defendant, although that seems to have been its usual construction, is not unreasonable. A condition of the public mind may exist in a locality which would impel a public prosecutor, in an honest effort to discharge his duty, to at least call the trial judge’s attention to circumstances indicating that he had, although without corrupt intent, prejudged the case and that it should be tried by another. This would involve no question of personal integrity, afford at least a fair opportunity for tthe State to conduct the prosecution free from any possible ulterior influence, and in no wise interfere with any right accorded to the defendant. Let us suppose, although the illustration may be remote, a condition of the public mind where the doctrine of meum and tuum, so far as it applies to the sacredness of public property, has come to be lightly regarded, and while a proper sensitiveness as to the rights of private individuals may prevail, as to the rights of the public, “the good old rule sufficeth them, the simple plan, that they should take who have the power and they should keep who can.” Where this standard of right prevails its influence may possibly extend to a greater or less degree to the instrumentalities employed in the administration of justice. Judges themselves, although unconscious of same,""may be subject to this influence. Where it exists justice cannot be fairly administered by those subject thereto. The remedy is simple. Upon the suggestion of prejudice being made under Section 5198, the judge, prompted by that sense of delicacy and duty which renders him averse to judicial action upon an intimation of his interest in the matter at issue, will retire and call in another to try the case. Section 5201, Re*121vised Statutes 1909, reasonably construed, will authorize this course. Such a course' would indicate a high sense of official duty, as well as a dispassionate purpose on the part of the judge, to free the case from even an intimation that he could not fairly conduct it. The reasoning of this court in awarding a writ of prohibition against a circuit judge in State ex rel. v. Wear, 129 Mo. 619, gives favorable color to the correctness of the foregoing conclusion. While the facts in that case are somewhat different from those in the case at bar, the construction given to Section 5198 (then Section 4174) is strongly persuasive of what constitutes a proper application of that section. In the Wear ease the ground of disqualification which the judge himself had recognized, was relationship to the accused. The judge, recognizing this relationship and its consequent disqualifying effect, had called in a judge from an adjoining circuit, hut when he appeared to try the case Judge Wear refused to surrender the court room to him or otherwise permit him to proceed. Thereupon the prosecuting attorney of the county where the case was pending applied for and was granted a writ, of prohibition. This court in granting the writ cited the Constitution (Sec. 29, Art. 6), which provides in the event of a vacancy in the office of a judge or his inability for any cause to hold a term or part of a term, the same may be held by a judge of any other circuit; and at the request of a judge of any circuit, any term or part of a term, in the circuit of the judge unable to hold the court, may he held by the judge of any other circuit. The Legislature is authorized to make such provisions for the holding of court as is found necessary. “In obedience to this command of the Constitution” says the court, “the Legislature enacted Section 4174, Revised Statutes 1889.” The section is then set forth in full and is identical in its terms with what is now Section 5198. As a method to render this section operative, Section 4178, Revised Statutes 1889 (now Section 5201), was enacted which provides how and under what circumstances, when the incompetency of a judge *122is alleged, another may be called in. In discussing these constitutional and statutory provisions the court said: “It is plain that Judge ""Wear by his relation to his son, the defendant, was disqualified, and knowing this, it was his imperative duty to either order the election of a special judge or to call in the judge of another circuit to sit in the trial of the said indictment.” As a logical conclusion flowing from this reasoning it would seem that the duty of the judge, whose right to sit was challenged, would be equally imperative, regardless of the ground of disqualification urged if within the terms of the statute. For the reasons stated, we are of the opinion that the judgment against the petitioners should be set aside and that they should be discharged. It is so ordered.

6211579_1,3306,"OPINION OF THE COURT Ralph A. Beisner, J. This action was tried before the court over four days, from May 13, 1996 to May 16, 1996. The plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment rescinding a lease with the defendant and attendant damages. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to reveal the nature of the business that it intended to operate from the plaintiff ’ s rental property. The defendant * 144counterclaims for damages as a result of the plaintiffs breach of the lease. The plaintiff called Colleen Quinn and David Sorbaro as witnesses and read portions of the examination before trial of Dennis Lesieur. The defendant called Dennis Lesieur, Anthony Nota and Daniel Geribo. Plaintiff recalled Mr. Sorbaro and Charles Murdock in rebuttal and the defendant read portions of the deposition of Mr. Lesieur in surrebuttal. Both parties have submitted memoranda of law and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for the court ’ s consideration. The following constitutes the decision of the court. FINDINGS OF FACT Plaintiff is a New York general partnership with an office at 186 North Bedford Road, Mount Kisco, New York. Defendant is a Rhode Island corporation with an office at 1800 Mineral Springs Road, Providence, Rhode Island. Plaintiff is the owner of the Westside Plaza, a commercial building located at South Road, Poughkeepsie, New York. In September 1992 plaintiff was offering a vacant store in that property for rent. On September 1, 1992, the defendant ’ s general manager, Dennis Lesieur, telephoned Colleen Quinn who was a licensed real estate salesperson working with CB Commercial Real Estate, a real estate broker who had been retained by the plaintiff to offer the vacant store for rent. Mr. Lesieur indicated that the defendant was interested in renting the vacant store. In response to a request from Ms. Quinn for information, about the defendant ’ s business enterprises, Mr. Lesieur advised Ms. Quinn that the defendant was a Rhode Island corporation that operated video stores in Rhode Island, Maine, Massachusetts and Connecticut. He stated to Ms. Quinn that the defendant did not have any stores in New York and was interested in entering the New York market. At the time that these representations were made by Mr. Lesieur, the defendant operated two stores in New York, one on River Street in Troy and the other on Hamilton Street in Poughkeepsie. Mr. Lesieur knew that such stores were being operated by the defendant at that time. On September 17, 1992, Mr. Lesieur met Ms. Quinn at the plaintiffs store on South Road. During that meeting, Ms. Quinn made reference to the competition that the defendant would experience from a nearby Blockbuster Video store and a nearby * 145Video Treats store. In response to that reference, Mr. Lesieur stated that the defendant did not compete with Blockbuster Video or Video Treats because the defendant sold videos and did not rent them as did Blockbuster Video and Video Treats. Ms. Quinn then asked Mr. Lesieur if his company was like Sun Coast Video, a video store chain which sold videos and which catered to the children ’ s market, and Mr. Lesieur said yes. Mr. Lesieur ’ s acknowledgment that there was a similarity between defendant ’ s stores and Sun Coast Video was false because there was no similarity in the products sold by defendant and the products sold by Sun Coast and Mr. Lesieur knew that any such comparison was inaccurate. On September 22, 1992, Mr. Lesieur sent a written proposal to Ms. Quinn in which defendant offered to rent the vacant store from the plaintiff. The written proposal stated that the defendant operated 22 video stores but did not specify the States in which it operated or further identify the nature of the videos marketed by the defendant or indicate that defendant marketed any other merchandise. On that same date defendant sent Ms. Quinn its financial statement. In a note in the financial statement the defendant ’ s business was described as "" the retail sale of videos and magazines to the general public ”. Prior to and during the time that Mr. Lesieur was negotiating with Ms. Quinn for rental of the store, only a small part of defendant ’ s business consisted of sales of periodicals and videos intended for the general public. The bulk of defendant ’ s business consisted of the sale of videos that could be described variously as x - rated, adult, or pornographic ; the sale of sexual aids and paraphernalia ; the sale of x - rated, adult, or pornographic magazines ; and the operation of video booths showing x - rated, adult, or pornographic videos. Minors were not permitted to enter any of defendant ’ s stores at that time. Thus, during the course of the negotiations between Mr. Lesieur and Ms. Quinn, when Mr. Lesieur described the defendant ’ s business as the operation of video stores, that characterization was false and Mr. Lesieur knew it to be false. At no time prior to the execution of the lease between the defendant and the plaintiff did Ms. Quinn or David Sorbaro or anyone else on behalf of the plaintiff conduct any investigation of the defendant other than the review of the defendant ’ s financial statement. They relied solely upon the oral statements made by Mr. Lesieur and the defendant ’ s financial statement that was presented to them by Mr. Lesieur in determin * 146ing the nature of defendant ’ s business and executing the lease with the defendant. In the course of numerous other lease negotiations prior to the negotiation with the defendant, neither Ms. Quinn nor Mr. Sorbaro had ever conducted any investigations to confirm the nature of the business being done by any other prospective tenants, other than the review of financial statements presented to them by such other prospective tenants. Dennis Lesieur had limited experience in negotiating leases for the defendant between 1989 and 1992. He had negotiated approximately four leases in that time. On several occasions he had specified the products that defendant sold and the leases were never signed. Thereafter it was Mr. Lesieur ’ s policy not to disclose the specific nature of the defendant ’ s business. This was his policy in the negotiations with the plaintiff. At the time that the defendant was negotiating with the plaintiff to lease plaintiff ’ s store and continuously thereafter, defendant intended to operate video booths in the plaintiff ’ s store but intentionally failed to disclose this fact to the plaintiff. During mid - October 1992, a written lease prepared by the plaintiff ’ s attorney pertaining to the vacant store was executed by the defendant and the plaintiff. The lease permitted the defendant to use the plaintiff ’ s premises for retail purposes. The lease required the defendant to comply with all local ordinances and laws. The lease also required the defendant to perform interior construction to make the store ready for its occupancy. The defendant gave the plaintiff two months ’ rent of $ 7, 975 as a security deposit and the first month ’ s rent of $ 3, 987. 50. Defendant ’ s employees commenced construction of lighting soffits for the interior of the store and retained a contractor to install an interior partition wall in the store. In early December 1992, the defendant ’ s construction employees and its independent contractor worked at the store. During this time period the defendant ’ s independent contractor erected the interior partition wall and the defendant ’ s employees began installing the soffits that had been constructed at the defendant ’ s workshop and installed some lighting fixtures. During the same period of time, December 1, 1992, through December 7, 1992, a separate contractor, Charles Murdock, was working for the plaintiff and remodeling the bathroom in the premises to make it handicapped equipped. While Mr. Mur * 147dock was working in the premises, he had discussions with one or more of the defendant ’ s employees. One of them advised him that after the premises were opened for business the defendant intended to install video viewing booths which customers would use to view erotic or x - rated videos and that this was a major portion of the defendant ’ s business. The same employee of the defendant also advised Mr. Murdock that the defendant already operated a store in Poughkeepsie, called the Hamilton Book and Video Store, which sold x - rated videos and magazines and also had x - rated video booths. When Mr. Murdock received the foregoing information he relayed it to David Sorbaro, the plaintiffs managing partner. Mr. Sorbaro then called his attorney, George Barnett, and Mr. Barnett telephoned Mr. Lesieur. During the course of the telephone conversation between Mr. Barnett and Mr. Lesieur, Mr. Barnett asked Mr. Lesieur if the defendant intended to install x - rated video booths in the plaintiffs store and Mr. Lesieur stated that it did not so intend. Mr. Barnett also asked ■ Mr. Lesieur whether the defendant owned the Hamilton Book and Video Store in Poughkeepsie and Mr. Lesieur declined to answer. At the end of business on December 7, 1992, pursuant to the instructions of David Sorbaro, Mr. Murdock changed the locks on plaintiffs store and wired the front door of the store shut. At the time that the defendant ’ s construction employees left the plaintiffs store at the end of business on December 7, 1992, they removed all of their tools from the premises, but left the partially installed soffits in place and also left some sheets of wall board, some ceiling tiles and some electric lights. Defendant was permitted to reenter the plaintiffs store on March 15, 1994, after plaintiff rented one half of the store to another tenant. On that date, the defendant was permitted to remove the soffits and the materials that had been left behind by the defendant and all of such materials were removed by the defendant. In 1992 the defendant operated 22 stores, two of which were in New York State. Each store derived at least two thirds of its income from the sale of pornographic products. At least 10 % of sales were in pornographic paraphernalia. Many of the stores contained viewing booths which allowed customers to enter a private booth for the purpose of viewing pornographic, erotic and sexually explicit videos. It is agreed that the premises are no longer suitable for the defendant ’ s business purposes. * 148CONCLUSIONS OF LAW The initial issue for resolution by this court is whether on the facts of this case the defendant tenant fraudulently misrepresented by affirmative statement and silence the nature of the business it intended to conduct on the plaintiff landlord ’ s premises. To sustain a cause of action for fraud, there must be a representation of fact which is either untrue and known to be untrue or recklessly made, and which is offered to deceive the other party and to induce them to act upon it, causing injury ( Jo Ann Homes at Bellmore v Dworetz, 25 NY2d 112, 119 ; Brown v Lockwood, 76 AD2d 721, 730 - 731 ). The defendant ’ s agent, Dennis Lesieur, had a policy of not telling prospective landlords the specific nature of the defendant ’ s business since on previous occasions the prospective landlords had refused to consummate leaseholds. This state of mind, coupled with the facts that Lesieur had disclosed, such as the comparison to Sun Coast Video and the description of its business as the retail sale of videos and magazines to the general public, and the facts that Lesieur had not disclosed, such as the sale of sexually explicit paraphernalia, require the court to conclude that the defendant did intentionally misrepresent material facts which induced the plaintiff to enter into this lease. The law is clear that fraud in the inducement is grounds for rescission of the agreement ( e. g., Taylor & Jennings v Bellino Bros. Constr. Co., 106 AD2d 779, 780 ). Fraud in the inducement must be proven by a standard of clear and convincing evidence rather than only a fair preponderance of the credible evidence ( see, Mix v Neff, 99 AD2d 180, 183 ). The court finds that the plaintiff has sustained its burden of proof and is entitled to rescission of this lease. While it is not necessary to the determination herein, this court further finds that the sexually explicit nature of a pornographic video and paraphernalia retail store creates an affirmative duty on the part of the tenant to disclose the specific nature of the proposed use to the prospective landlord. It is recognized that sexually explicit material enjoys the protection of constitutional free speech ( US Const 1st, 14th Amends ; NY Const, art I, § 8 ; see, People ex rel. Arcara v Cloud Books, 68 NY2d 553 ). It must also be recognized that many individuals consider pornography and sexually explicit material to be personally abhorrent, offensive, demeaning, and violative of their personal, social or religious values. It should also * 149be recognized that a store such as that operated by this defendant may have an adverse economic impact on adjacent properties to that owned by the landlord ( see generally, Matter of Town of lslip v Caviglia, 73 NY2d 544, 551 ). It is established law that a municipality may not legislate a blanket prohibition based on content of the material to be sold ( Matter of Town of Islip v Caviglia, supra, at 554 ), but the issues in this litigation deal with the respective rights of private citizens. This is the distinction which makes this a ruling of first impression. There is no discernable public interest which would require the courts to foist on a landlord a pornographic use of his or her private property by virtue of the silence of the prospective tenant. Prospective landlords, therefore, should have the right to make an informed decision regarding such a use of his or her property, whether that decision is motivated by personal values, societal values or economics. Clearly this requirement of disclosure may have application to other objectionable, albeit legal, uses between a landlord and tenant. The sale of Nazi memorabilia, gun stores and unorthodox houses of worship are some examples of uses which could reasonably be expected to violate the personal or societal values of a property owner and impose an equitable duty on a prospective tenant of complete and forthright disclosure. For the reasons stated this court finds that a tenant who intends to use a rental space for the sale of sexually explicit material has an affirmative duty to disclose such a use to the landlord. Failure to do so entitles the landlord to rescission of the lease. DAMAGES The plaintiff ’ s claims for punitive or compensable damages are denied. There has been an insufficient showing that the plaintiff has suffered any compensatory damages as a result of the defendant ’ s fraud. Punitive damages are not warranted because it does not appear that the fraud was upon the general public ( Diker v Cathray Constr. Corp., 158 AD2d 657, 658 ). The proof has shown that defendant paid to the plaintiff two months ’ rent as security and one month ’ s rent totaling $ 11, 962. 50. The defendant is awarded this amount as actual damages. * 150The defendant ’ s claim for conversion of tools and building materials after it was denied access to the premises is denied. The proof adduced at the trial is insufficient to support an award of damages for conversion.",6211579," OPINION OF THE COURT Ralph A. Beisner, J. This action was tried before the court over four days, from May 13, 1996 to May 16, 1996. The plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment rescinding a lease with the defendant and attendant damages. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to reveal the nature of the business that it intended to operate from the plaintiff’s rental property. The defendant *144counterclaims for damages as a result of the plaintiffs breach of the lease. The plaintiff called Colleen Quinn and David Sorbaro as witnesses and read portions of the examination before trial of Dennis Lesieur. The defendant called Dennis Lesieur, Anthony Nota and Daniel Geribo. Plaintiff recalled Mr. Sorbaro and Charles Murdock in rebuttal and the defendant read portions of the deposition of Mr. Lesieur in surrebuttal. Both parties have submitted memoranda of law and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for the court’s consideration. The following constitutes the decision of the court. FINDINGS OF FACT Plaintiff is a New York general partnership with an office at 186 North Bedford Road, Mount Kisco, New York. Defendant is a Rhode Island corporation with an office at 1800 Mineral Springs Road, Providence, Rhode Island. Plaintiff is the owner of the Westside Plaza, a commercial building located at South Road, Poughkeepsie, New York. In September 1992 plaintiff was offering a vacant store in that property for rent. On September 1, 1992, the defendant’s general manager, Dennis Lesieur, telephoned Colleen Quinn who was a licensed real estate salesperson working with CB Commercial Real Estate, a real estate broker who had been retained by the plaintiff to offer the vacant store for rent. Mr. Lesieur indicated that the defendant was interested in renting the vacant store. In response to a request from Ms. Quinn for information, about the defendant’s business enterprises, Mr. Lesieur advised Ms. Quinn that the defendant was a Rhode Island corporation that operated video stores in Rhode Island, Maine, Massachusetts and Connecticut. He stated to Ms. Quinn that the defendant did not have any stores in New York and was interested in entering the New York market. At the time that these representations were made by Mr. Lesieur, the defendant operated two stores in New York, one on River Street in Troy and the other on Hamilton Street in Poughkeepsie. Mr. Lesieur knew that such stores were being operated by the defendant at that time. On September 17, 1992, Mr. Lesieur met Ms. Quinn at the plaintiffs store on South Road. During that meeting, Ms. Quinn made reference to the competition that the defendant would experience from a nearby Blockbuster Video store and a nearby *145Video Treats store. In response to that reference, Mr. Lesieur stated that the defendant did not compete with Blockbuster Video or Video Treats because the defendant sold videos and did not rent them as did Blockbuster Video and Video Treats. Ms. Quinn then asked Mr. Lesieur if his company was like Sun Coast Video, a video store chain which sold videos and which catered to the children’s market, and Mr. Lesieur said yes. Mr. Lesieur’s acknowledgment that there was a similarity between defendant’s stores and Sun Coast Video was false because there was no similarity in the products sold by defendant and the products sold by Sun Coast and Mr. Lesieur knew that any such comparison was inaccurate. On September 22, 1992, Mr. Lesieur sent a written proposal to Ms. Quinn in which defendant offered to rent the vacant store from the plaintiff. The written proposal stated that the defendant operated 22 video stores but did not specify the States in which it operated or further identify the nature of the videos marketed by the defendant or indicate that defendant marketed any other merchandise. On that same date defendant sent Ms. Quinn its financial statement. In a note in the financial statement the defendant’s business was described as ""the retail sale of videos and magazines to the general public”. Prior to and during the time that Mr. Lesieur was negotiating with Ms. Quinn for rental of the store, only a small part of defendant’s business consisted of sales of periodicals and videos intended for the general public. The bulk of defendant’s business consisted of the sale of videos that could be described variously as x-rated, adult, or pornographic; the sale of sexual aids and paraphernalia; the sale of x-rated, adult, or pornographic magazines; and the operation of video booths showing x-rated, adult, or pornographic videos. Minors were not permitted to enter any of defendant’s stores at that time. Thus, during the course of the negotiations between Mr. Lesieur and Ms. Quinn, when Mr. Lesieur described the defendant’s business as the operation of video stores, that characterization was false and Mr. Lesieur knew it to be false. At no time prior to the execution of the lease between the defendant and the plaintiff did Ms. Quinn or David Sorbaro or anyone else on behalf of the plaintiff conduct any investigation of the defendant other than the review of the defendant’s financial statement. They relied solely upon the oral statements made by Mr. Lesieur and the defendant’s financial statement that was presented to them by Mr. Lesieur in determin*146ing the nature of defendant’s business and executing the lease with the defendant. In the course of numerous other lease negotiations prior to the negotiation with the defendant, neither Ms. Quinn nor Mr. Sorbaro had ever conducted any investigations to confirm the nature of the business being done by any other prospective tenants, other than the review of financial statements presented to them by such other prospective tenants. Dennis Lesieur had limited experience in negotiating leases for the defendant between 1989 and 1992. He had negotiated approximately four leases in that time. On several occasions he had specified the products that defendant sold and the leases were never signed. Thereafter it was Mr. Lesieur’s policy not to disclose the specific nature of the defendant’s business. This was his policy in the negotiations with the plaintiff. At the time that the defendant was negotiating with the plaintiff to lease plaintiff’s store and continuously thereafter, defendant intended to operate video booths in the plaintiff’s store but intentionally failed to disclose this fact to the plaintiff. During mid-October 1992, a written lease prepared by the plaintiff’s attorney pertaining to the vacant store was executed by the defendant and the plaintiff. The lease permitted the defendant to use the plaintiff’s premises for retail purposes. The lease required the defendant to comply with all local ordinances and laws. The lease also required the defendant to perform interior construction to make the store ready for its occupancy. The defendant gave the plaintiff two months’ rent of $7,975 as a security deposit and the first month’s rent of $3,987.50. Defendant’s employees commenced construction of lighting soffits for the interior of the store and retained a contractor to install an interior partition wall in the store. In early December 1992, the defendant’s construction employees and its independent contractor worked at the store. During this time period the defendant’s independent contractor erected the interior partition wall and the defendant’s employees began installing the soffits that had been constructed at the defendant’s workshop and installed some lighting fixtures. During the same period of time, December 1, 1992, through December 7, 1992, a separate contractor, Charles Murdock, was working for the plaintiff and remodeling the bathroom in the premises to make it handicapped equipped. While Mr. Mur*147dock was working in the premises, he had discussions with one or more of the defendant’s employees. One of them advised him that after the premises were opened for business the defendant intended to install video viewing booths which customers would use to view erotic or x-rated videos and that this was a major portion of the defendant’s business. The same employee of the defendant also advised Mr. Murdock that the defendant already operated a store in Poughkeepsie, called the Hamilton Book and Video Store, which sold x-rated videos and magazines and also had x-rated video booths. When Mr. Murdock received the foregoing information he relayed it to David Sorbaro, the plaintiffs managing partner. Mr. Sorbaro then called his attorney, George Barnett, and Mr. Barnett telephoned Mr. Lesieur. During the course of the telephone conversation between Mr. Barnett and Mr. Lesieur, Mr. Barnett asked Mr. Lesieur if the defendant intended to install x-rated video booths in the plaintiffs store and Mr. Lesieur stated that it did not so intend. Mr. Barnett also asked ■ Mr. Lesieur whether the defendant owned the Hamilton Book and Video Store in Poughkeepsie and Mr. Lesieur declined to answer. At the end of business on December 7, 1992, pursuant to the instructions of David Sorbaro, Mr. Murdock changed the locks on plaintiffs store and wired the front door of the store shut. At the time that the defendant’s construction employees left the plaintiffs store at the end of business on December 7, 1992, they removed all of their tools from the premises, but left the partially installed soffits in place and also left some sheets of wall board, some ceiling tiles and some electric lights. Defendant was permitted to reenter the plaintiffs store on March 15, 1994, after plaintiff rented one half of the store to another tenant. On that date, the defendant was permitted to remove the soffits and the materials that had been left behind by the defendant and all of such materials were removed by the defendant. In 1992 the defendant operated 22 stores, two of which were in New York State. Each store derived at least two thirds of its income from the sale of pornographic products. At least 10% of sales were in pornographic paraphernalia. Many of the stores contained viewing booths which allowed customers to enter a private booth for the purpose of viewing pornographic, erotic and sexually explicit videos. It is agreed that the premises are no longer suitable for the defendant’s business purposes. *148CONCLUSIONS OF LAW The initial issue for resolution by this court is whether on the facts of this case the defendant tenant fraudulently misrepresented by affirmative statement and silence the nature of the business it intended to conduct on the plaintiff landlord’s premises. To sustain a cause of action for fraud, there must be a representation of fact which is either untrue and known to be untrue or recklessly made, and which is offered to deceive the other party and to induce them to act upon it, causing injury (Jo Ann Homes at Bellmore v Dworetz, 25 NY2d 112, 119; Brown v Lockwood, 76 AD2d 721, 730-731). The defendant’s agent, Dennis Lesieur, had a policy of not telling prospective landlords the specific nature of the defendant’s business since on previous occasions the prospective landlords had refused to consummate leaseholds. This state of mind, coupled with the facts that Lesieur had disclosed, such as the comparison to Sun Coast Video and the description of its business as the retail sale of videos and magazines to the general public, and the facts that Lesieur had not disclosed, such as the sale of sexually explicit paraphernalia, require the court to conclude that the defendant did intentionally misrepresent material facts which induced the plaintiff to enter into this lease. The law is clear that fraud in the inducement is grounds for rescission of the agreement (e.g., Taylor & Jennings v Bellino Bros. Constr. Co., 106 AD2d 779, 780). Fraud in the inducement must be proven by a standard of clear and convincing evidence rather than only a fair preponderance of the credible evidence (see, Mix v Neff, 99 AD2d 180, 183). The court finds that the plaintiff has sustained its burden of proof and is entitled to rescission of this lease. While it is not necessary to the determination herein, this court further finds that the sexually explicit nature of a pornographic video and paraphernalia retail store creates an affirmative duty on the part of the tenant to disclose the specific nature of the proposed use to the prospective landlord. It is recognized that sexually explicit material enjoys the protection of constitutional free speech (US Const 1st, 14th Amends; NY Const, art I, § 8; see, People ex rel. Arcara v Cloud Books, 68 NY2d 553). It must also be recognized that many individuals consider pornography and sexually explicit material to be personally abhorrent, offensive, demeaning, and violative of their personal, social or religious values. It should also *149be recognized that a store such as that operated by this defendant may have an adverse economic impact on adjacent properties to that owned by the landlord (see generally, Matter of Town of lslip v Caviglia, 73 NY2d 544, 551). It is established law that a municipality may not legislate a blanket prohibition based on content of the material to be sold (Matter of Town of Islip v Caviglia, supra, at 554), but the issues in this litigation deal with the respective rights of private citizens. This is the distinction which makes this a ruling of first impression. There is no discernable public interest which would require the courts to foist on a landlord a pornographic use of his or her private property by virtue of the silence of the prospective tenant. Prospective landlords, therefore, should have the right to make an informed decision regarding such a use of his or her property, whether that decision is motivated by personal values, societal values or economics. Clearly this requirement of disclosure may have application to other objectionable, albeit legal, uses between a landlord and tenant. The sale of Nazi memorabilia, gun stores and unorthodox houses of worship are some examples of uses which could reasonably be expected to violate the personal or societal values of a property owner and impose an equitable duty on a prospective tenant of complete and forthright disclosure. For the reasons stated this court finds that a tenant who intends to use a rental space for the sale of sexually explicit material has an affirmative duty to disclose such a use to the landlord. Failure to do so entitles the landlord to rescission of the lease. DAMAGES The plaintiff’s claims for punitive or compensable damages are denied. There has been an insufficient showing that the plaintiff has suffered any compensatory damages as a result of the defendant’s fraud. Punitive damages are not warranted because it does not appear that the fraud was upon the general public (Diker v Cathray Constr. Corp., 158 AD2d 657, 658). The proof has shown that defendant paid to the plaintiff two months’ rent as security and one month’s rent totaling $11,962.50. The defendant is awarded this amount as actual damages. *150The defendant’s claim for conversion of tools and building materials after it was denied access to the premises is denied. The proof adduced at the trial is insufficient to support an award of damages for conversion.

5671539_1,584,"* 129Order, Supreme Court, New York County ( Edward Lehner, J. ), entered December 17, 2002, which granted defendant ’ s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, and denied plaintiffs cross motion for summary judgment, unanimously affirmed, without costs. Notwithstanding the litany of allegations of negligence in this legal malpractice action, plaintiff has produced no evidence of the sine qua non of his fraudulent conveyance case, namely, that his wife purchased the subject property in 1973 with money plaintiff had received only months earlier in settlement of a personal injury action. According to plaintiff, his wife withdrew that money from their joint account and used it to acquire the property from her brother. Sixteen years later, his wife conveyed the property to her brother ’ s wife. Plaintiff claims that defendant negligently failed to expose his former wife ’ s use of marital funds to acquire the property in the first place. But this claim is undermined by plaintiffs own inability, even now, to offer any documentary evidence that she used marital funds to acquire that property in 1973. What we have is mere speculation of a loss resulting from an attorney ’ s alleged omissions, which is insufficient to sustain a claim for legal malpractice ( Luniewski v Zeitlin, 188 AD2d 642, 643 [ 1992 ] ). As to the claim for breach of the retainer agreement, even though plaintiff received only minimal notice of his attorney ’ s application for withdrawal, which followed plaintiffs threat to sue for malpractice, as the court found, plaintiff explicitly consented to the withdrawal. At the time of that acquiescence, plaintiff expressed interest in settling the divorce action, which he did six months later. Thus, even if defendant had breached the retainer agreement, plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that he incurred any damages as a result. Although the court did not address plaintiffs Judiciary Law § 487 claim for deceit, it is apparent, from a search of the record, that defendant ’ s alleged violation of the statute did not amount to a chronic or extreme pattern of legal delinquency warranting civil relief and the imposition of treble damages ( see Schindler v Issler & Schrage, 262 AD2d 226, 228 [ 1999 ], lv dismissed 94 NY2d 791 [ 1999 ] ). Even if damages were an appropriate recourse for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility, plaintiff has nonetheless failed to demonstrate that he incurred any damages from his attorney ’ s alleged deceit. We have considered plaintiffs remaining claims and find them to be without merit. Concur — Mazzarelli, J.

8309687_1,2445,"Gresham, D. J. The petitioner, Henry I. Bruning, by this proceeding seeks to recover damages for injuries sustained in coupling, cars at North Vernon, Indiana, while in the service of the receiver. The petitioner and others, on the fifth day of January, 1880, were making up a freight train at this point to go south over the Louisville branch of the Ohio, etc., Railroad Company. He was assisting as brakeman in switching and coupling, and finally ran along with the train as it backed up to a coal car, and hurriedly stepped in between this car and the rear car of the train, when they were three or four feet apart, to make the coupling. Instead of meeting or bumping together, as they should have done, the draw - bars passed each other, and allowed the ends of the cars to come together, or so near together as to seriously injure the petitioner. The strip which supported the draw - bar of the coal car and hold it up had become unbolted at one end, the nut being missing, and the draw - bar was thus allowed to drop far enough below its proper position to miss the draw - bar of the forward car and pass under it. There was some evidence tending to show that the “ dead - wood, ” which is a block bolted on the end of the car, above the * 278draw - bar, to assist in keeping the ears from coming together, was imperfect, it being worn away as much as a few inches. If the coal car had not been out of repair the draw - bars would have met or bumped instead of passing, and the coupling would have been made without injury to the petitioner. This coal car, which belonged to the company and had been in use for nine years, was, it appears from the evidence, brought from Washington, Indiana, loaded with coal, the evening or the night before the accident. The car inspector at Washington testified that he had inspected all cars on leaving that place the day before the accident, and none of them, so far as he observed, were out of repair. And three of the four car inspectors at Seymour testified that they had inspected all trains passing there from the west the same day and the night of that day, two performing the labor together during the day, and the third alone at night, and that the cars all seemed to be in proper condition. ■ There were no car inspectors at North Yernon at this time, but one appears to have been appointed for that place some months later. This appointment was made, however, it is claimed for the receiver, on account of the great increase of business at this point after the accident. There is no evidence that the coal car, or any other ears, were inspected at North Yernon. The petitioner testified that he did not notice the condition of the coal car until he ran in and took hold of the link to make the coupling, and that he did not discover his peril until it was too late to escape. He was caught between the ends of the cars when they came together, and seriously injured in his right side and chest. The physician who was called in after the accident, and who treated the petitioner for some time afterwards, testified that he found a depression of at least two inches on the right side, the ribs from the fifth down, on that side, being forced in that far ; that he did not succeed by, manipulation and bandaging in entirely removing this depression ; that the right lung and the membrane surrounding it were seriously injured ; that some months after the accident he thought, on examination, that he found an accumulation of pus in the lower part of the right lung, corresponding to the place of injury, and tubercular deposits in the top of this lung ; that the petitioner was not able to work, and the chances were that he never would be. During the year prior to the accident the petitioner had an attack of lung fever, from which he seemed to recover, and again went to work. He was a man of average health and strength, and there was * 279no evidence that he inherited any tendency to lung disease. Nine or ten weeks after receiving the injury he undertook to resume work on the road, but owing to his feeble condition he was compelled to rest at frequent intervals, sometimes for a week or longer. At the time his testimony was taken, which was two years or more after the accident, he was unable to work. It is not denied that his injuries were serious, very painful, and, perhaps, permanent. It is urged for the receiver that the testimony failed to show want of proper care on his part, or that of his managing agents ; that if any carelessness was shown it was the carelessness of the car inspectors, who should have discovered the damaged condition of the car before the accident, and ordered it into the shops for repairs ; that the petitioner was compensated by his wages for his services, and all risks incident to his employment, including the carelessness of the car inspectors, who were liis fellow - servants ; and, finally, that the petitioner, by his own negligence, contributed to his injury by running in between the cars to make the coupling without using his eyes and discovering in time the dangerous condition of the coal car. It is 100 miles from Washington, where the coal car was loaded, to North Vernon, and from Seymour to the same place the distance is only 15 miles. It is not denied that the coal car was out of repair and unfit for use at the time of the accident, and in view of its then condition it is probable that the defects already described existed when the car passed Seymour, and even when it was loaded at Washington. These defects, when tiie car was detached, were plainly visible on examination, but when it was coupled up in a train and the draw - bar thus somewhat held in position, they were more liable to escape observation. But whatever the condition of this car may have been at Washington and Seymour, trains were made up at North Vernon, where the defective car was switched off on a side track to go south over the Louisville branch, and if proper care had been used at this point its damaged condition would have been discovered, and it would have been condemned for repairs instead of having been ordered into the train as it was. It is not the law in the federal courts, nor is it believed to be the law in all of the state courts, that the master is relieved from responsibility in all cases in which a servant is injured by the negligence of a fellow - servant. The master ’ s immunity is limited to cases where the servants are engaged in the same common employment ; that is to say, in the same department of duty. Such immunity does * 280not extend to cases where the servants are engaged in departments essentially foreign to each other. A servant cannot be held to have contemplated, in the adjustment of his wages, those dangers which arise from the carelessness of fellow - servants, without any reference whatever to the nature of their employment or duties. Hough v. Texas, etc., R. Co. 100 U. S. 213 ; Indianapolis, etc., R. Co. v. Morganstein, 15 Chi. Leg. News. But, without further discussion of the question of the master ’ s immunity, I prefer forest the decision on other ground. It is his duty to furnish his employes with proper machinery or instrumentalities for their use in the work assigned them, and to see to it that the same are kept in a reasonably - safe condition, or in reasonable repair. He may intrust this duty to others, but he cannot by so doing escape the responsibility for its negligent non - performance. The acts of his agents in this regard are his acts ; their negligence is his negligence. This rule applies to individuals, and there is no good reason for exempting railroad and other corporations from its operation. It is true that corporations can act only by their agents, but that is no reason for not holding them to the same personal responsibility as natural persons. Conduct which Amounts to personal negligence as against an individual should and does amount to the same thing against a corporation acting by its proper officers or agents. Railroad companies are bound to use due care in seeing that their cars and other rolling stock are maintained in a reasonably - safe condition ; and when an. employe, — a brakeman, for instance, — in the proper discharge of his duty, is injured from a failure on the part of the company to perform this personal duty, it is liable. Houghs. Texas, etc., R. Co. supra ; Railroad Co. v. Fort, 17 Wall. 557 ; Dillon v. Union Pac. R. Co. 3 Dill. 319 ; Ford v. Railroad Co. 110 Mass. 241 ; Gibson v. Pac. R. Co. 46 Mo. 163. The master is bound to protect the servant, not against all risks, but against risks which could be avoided by the exercise of reasonable care on the part of the master. The brakeman ’ s employment exposes him to constant peril under the most favorable conditions. He is expected and required to act with dispatch in coupling and uncoupling cars, and when he is negligently required by the proper officers or agents to handle ears out of repair, unfit for use and dangerous, and in doing so is injured, perhaps for life, without fault on his part, he should, in justice, have a remedy against his employer. This road and all its possessions were in the hands of a receiver, who was operating it at the time of the accident. He, of course, sus - * 281famed to the petitioner the relation of master, and the neglect of his proper agent or agents to condemn the coal car and keep it out of use until repaired was his neglect, for which he is liable. It does not appear from the evidence that the petitioner knew the coal car was out of repair when he ran in, as he was accustomed to do, and as brakemen usually do, to make the coupling, or that, without stopping and looking before running in, he might have seen that it was unfit for use. He testified that he discovered for the first time when he was between the cars, and when it ' was too late to escape, that the draw - bars would not meet. Knowing that promptness in the discharge of his duties not only recommended him to his employer, but that it was required of him, the petitioner had a right to assume, without inspection, as he no doubt did, that the cars he was required to couple were in a proper state of repair for handling. It cannot be said from the evidence that the petitioner acted recklessly, or that he failed to use due care for his own preservation, and thus contributed to the injury. Ho earned $ 45 a month at his business before the accident ; he is now 31 years old, and he seems to have been industrious. His injuries were such that he is not expected to recover. It is fair to assume that he will never be able to perform active labor. I allow him damages in the sum of § 4, 000, including medicines, medical and board bills, and expenses of nursing.

It is urged for the receiver that the testimony failed to show want of proper care on his part, or that of his managing agents; that if any carelessness was shown it was the carelessness of the car inspectors, who should have discovered the damaged condition of the car before the accident, and ordered it into the shops for repairs; that the petitioner was compensated by his wages for his services, and all risks incident to his employment, including the carelessness of the car inspectors, who were liis fellow-servants; and, finally, that the petitioner, by his own negligence, contributed to his injury by running in between the cars to make the coupling without using his eyes and discovering in time the dangerous condition of the coal car. It is 100 miles from Washington, where the coal car was loaded, to North Vernon, and from Seymour to the same place the distance is only 15 miles. It is not denied that the coal car was out of repair and unfit for use at the time of the accident, and in view of its then condition it is probable that the defects already described existed when the car passed Seymour, and even when it was loaded at Washington. These defects, when tiie car was detached, were plainly visible on examination, but when it was coupled up in a train and the draw-bar thus somewhat held in position, they were more liable to escape observation. But whatever the condition of this car may have been at Washington and Seymour, trains were made up at North Vernon, where the defective car was switched off on a side track to go south over the Louisville branch, and if proper care had been used at this point its damaged condition would have been discovered, and it would have been condemned for repairs instead of having been ordered into the train as it was. It is not the law in the federal courts, nor is it believed to be the law in all of the state courts, that the master is relieved from responsibility in all cases in which a servant is injured by the negligence of a fellow-servant. The master’s immunity is limited to cases where the servants are engaged in the same common employment; that is to say, in the same department of duty. Such immunity does *280not extend to cases where the servants are engaged in departments essentially foreign to each other. A servant cannot be held to have contemplated, in the adjustment of his wages, those dangers which arise from the carelessness of fellow-servants, without any reference whatever to the nature of their employment or duties. Hough v. Texas, etc., R. Co. 100 U. S. 213; Indianapolis, etc., R. Co. v. Morganstein, 15 Chi. Leg. News. But, without further discussion of the question of the master’s immunity, I prefer forest the decision on other ground. It is his duty to furnish his employes with proper machinery or instrumentalities for their use in the work assigned them, and to see to it that the same are kept in a reasonably-safe condition, or in reasonable repair. He may intrust this duty to others, but he cannot by so doing escape the responsibility for its negligent non-performance. The acts of his agents in this regard are his acts; their negligence is his negligence. This rule applies to individuals, and there is no good reason for exempting railroad and other corporations from its operation. It is true that corporations can act only by their agents, but that is no reason for not holding them to the same personal responsibility as natural persons. Conduct which Amounts to personal negligence as against an individual should and does amount to the same thing against a corporation acting by its proper officers or agents. Railroad companies are bound to use due care in seeing that their cars and other rolling stock are maintained in a reasonably-safe condition; and when an.employe, — a brakeman, for instance, — in the proper discharge of his duty, is injured from a failure on the part of the company to perform this personal duty, it is liable. Houghs. Texas, etc., R. Co. supra; Railroad Co. v. Fort, 17 Wall. 557; Dillon v. Union Pac. R. Co. 3 Dill. 319; Ford v. Railroad Co. 110 Mass. 241; Gibson v. Pac. R. Co. 46 Mo. 163. The master is bound to protect the servant, not against all risks, but against risks which could be avoided by the exercise of reasonable care on the part of the master. The brakeman’s employment exposes him to constant peril under the most favorable conditions. He is expected and required to act with dispatch in coupling and uncoupling cars, and when he is negligently required by the proper officers or agents to handle ears out of repair, unfit for use and dangerous, and in doing so is injured, perhaps for life, without fault on his part, he should, in justice, have a remedy against his employer. This road and all its possessions were in the hands of a receiver, who was operating it at the time of the accident. He, of course, sus-*281famed to the petitioner the relation of master, and the neglect of his proper agent or agents to condemn the coal car and keep it out of use until repaired was his neglect, for which he is liable. It does not appear from the evidence that the petitioner knew the coal car was out of repair when he ran in, as he was accustomed to do, and as brakemen usually do, to make the coupling, or that, without stopping and looking before running in, he might have seen that it was unfit for use. He testified that he discovered for the first time when he was between the cars, and when it 'was too late to escape, that the draw-bars would not meet. Knowing that promptness in the discharge of his duties not only recommended him to his employer, but that it was required of him, the petitioner had a right to assume, without inspection, as he no doubt did, that the cars he was required to couple were in a proper state of repair for handling. It cannot be said from the evidence that the petitioner acted recklessly, or that he failed to use due care for his own preservation, and thus contributed to the injury. Ho earned $45 a month at his business before the accident; he is now 31 years old, and he seems to have been industrious. His injuries were such that he is not expected to recover. It is fair to assume that he will never be able to perform active labor. I allow him damages in the sum of §4,000, including medicines, medical and board bills, and expenses of nursing.

5702250_1,5807,"Halpern, J. This is an appeal from a decree of the Surrogate ’ s Court of Genesee County in a will construction proceeding which held that the surviving husband of the testatrix, Sarah M. Carlin, “ is the sole distributee of Sarah M. Carlin, deceased, and thereby entitled not only to the life use of the entire property of said deceased, but also to the gift and bequest of the remainder interest as well ’ ’. The will is very short. The donative provisions are as follows : ‘ ‘ First. After the payment of all my just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, I give, devise and bequeath the use of all my property, real and personal, to my husband, Walter T. Carlin and give him the privilege in case of necessity to use so much of the principal as may be necessary for his care and support. “ Upon the death of my husband, I give, devise and bequeath such of my property as shall then remain to my distributees under the laws of the State of New York. ” Analyzing these provisions, we find a clearly expressed testamentary scheme. The testatrix intended ( 1 ) to give her husband the income from her estate for life ; ( 2 ) to give him a limited right to invade the principal “ in case of necessity ” to * 283provide for his care and support ; ( 3 ) to give so much of the principal as remained upon his death to the testatrix ’ distributees. The will was executed on March 9, 1935. The testatrix died on October 13, 1944. Both at the time of the execution of the will and at the time of the death of the testatrix, the testatrix ’ husband was her closest relative under the statutory table of distribution and he would be her sole distributee, if her distributees were determined as of that time. The testatrix also left her surviving an uncle and cousins, the survivors of whom would be her distributees, if her distributees were determined as of the time of the death of her husband. The testatrix had never had any children and, at the time of the execution of the will, there was no reason to believe that she would have any before her death * ; she had never had brothers or sisters and her parents were dead. Therefore, there was no possibility of anyone other than her husband being her distributee, if her distributees were determined as of the time of her death, provided only that he survived her. In this situation, the inference is inescapable that the testatrix must have intended that the remainder should go to the persons who would be her distributees at the time of the death of her husband rather than at her own death. In making a gift ‘ ‘ to my distributees ’ ’ of what remained ‘ ‘ upon the death of my husband ’ ’, she must have meant the persons who would be her nearest relatives as of that time. This is the only construction which is consistent with the testamentary scheme expressed in the will. If the will were construed as requiring the determination of the distributees as of the time of the death of the testatrix, the result produced Avould be a Avholly incongruous one. The testatrix ’ husband would then be the sole distributee and he would take the remainder as well as the life estate. The life estate Avould merge with the remainder in fee and the husband would acquire at once a present fee simple absolute, notwithstanding the clearly expressed intention of the testatrix to limit his legal interest to that of a life tenant. Every aspect of the testamentary scheme would be frustrated if the will were construed as giving the husband a fee simple * 284absolute. The provision giving the ' husband a. limited power to use. the principal in case of necessity would be rendered meaningless by this construction. As the owner of. the fee, the husband could, of course,. expend the principal as he pleased. There would be then no need for a provision giving him a “ privilege ” to use the principal. Neither would the limitation on the privilege be effective. As the sole owner of the estate, the. husband would be in. a position to expend or dissipate the principal at once, without regard to the amount currently needed for his support, even though this left him without any income during the rest of his life. The salutary purpose of the testatrix to protect her husband against his own improvidence would thus be defeated. Furthermore, under the construction vesting the whole fee in the husband, he would be able to give or bequeath the property to relatives of his own or to strangers, thus defeating the testatrix ’ expressed intention that whatever remained on his death should go to “ my distributees ’ ’. Presumably, by this term she meant her own relatives. It is significant that while the husband was given the power to invade the principal during his lifetime, to the extent necessary for his care and support, he was not given any power to appoint the principal by will or, in any other manner, to dispose of the unconsumed balance of the principal on his death. This restriction would likewise be nullified by construing the will as giving the husband the whole fee. • The gift of the remainder to the testatrix ’ distributees is stated in the will in terms of á gift of whatever balance remains upon the husband ’ s death after he has used as much of the principal as. necessary. This formulation necessarily implies that the balance is to be paid over to some one other than the husband. Whether, there will. be any balance and, if so, how much, cannot be determined until the husband ’ s death. It is therefore reasonable to infer that, under the testamentary scheme, the distributees are also to be determined as of that time. . On the other hand, it is wholly unreasonable to attribute to the testatrix an intention to give to her husband a fee by the circuitous method of giving him a life estate by name and then giving him the remainder by describing him as her “ distributees ”. If the testatrix, had intended to, give her husband the whole fee, she could readily have so provided in a few simple words. There was no possible reason for the circumlocution. * 285It is hornbook law that the touchstone in all will construction cases is the intention of the testator, as ascertained from the language of the will, read as a whole in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of its execution ( Spencer v. Childs, 1 N Y 2d 103, 107 ). The testator ’ s intent “ must be gleaned * * * from a sympathetic reading of the will as an entirety and in view of all the facts and circumstances under which the provisions of the will were framed ” ( Matter of Fabbri, 2 N Y 2d 236, 240 ). “ The intention of the testatrix, so long as it is not contrary to some statute or to public policy, must govern ’ ’ ( Salter v. Browne, 205 F. Y. 204, 212 ). Since the intention of the testatrix in this case is self - evident, the only question which need concern us is whether there is any rule of law Avhich prevents us from carrying out her intention. We can find no such rule in the authorities. It is true that there is a general rule to the effect that a testator ’ s distributees are ordinarily to be determined as of the time of his death but this rule ‘ ‘ is not a rule of substantive law, but a rule of interpretation, which has been adopted by the courts as one means of ascertaining the intention of the testator as expressed in the will ; and it never should be used to defeat what, from the whole will, appears with reasonable certainty to have been his intention ” ( 57 Am. Jur., Wills, § 1279, p. 848 ). When a gift is made to persons “ to be determined by a statute governing the intestate succession of property, then the statute is applied as of the death of the designated ancestor, unless an intent of the conveyor to have the statute applied as of some other date is found from additional language or circumstances ” ( Bestatement, Property, § 308 ). In our case, the intent of the testatrix to postpone the determination of her distributees to the time of the death of the life tenant is readily inferable from the “ additional language ” of the will in this case and from the “ circumstances ” at the time of its execution. In a comment to the section quoted, the American Law Institute takes the view that where, a testator gives a life estate to a person who is presumptively his sole heir and then gives the remainder in terms to his “ heirs ”, the incongruity which would result from determining the heirs as of the time of the testator ’ s death is of itself sufficient to warrant an inference of an intention to postpone the time of the determination of the testator ’ s heirs to the death of the life tenant. ‘ ‘ When A, by will, conveys property ‘ to B for life then to my heirs ’ and B is the sole * 286heir of A * * * the fact that * * * B is the sole heir of A at the death of A tends to establish that A intended his heirs to be ascertained as of the death of B, so that B is prevented from sharing in the limitation to the heirs of A ” ( Restatement, Property, § 308, comment k ). To the same effect, see American Law of Property ( vol. 5, § 22. 60, pp. 441 - 443 ). As we have seen, in our case there is a much greater incongruity than that resulting from a construction which gives the remainder in fee to a sole heir who had theretofore been given a life estate. There is the additional incongruity which grows out of the fact that the testatrix had expressly given the life tenant a limited power to invade the principal to the extent necessary for his care and support ; this provision is wholly incongruous with a construction which gives the remainder in fee to the life tenant. This basic incongruity can be escaped only by postponing the time of the determination of the testatrix ’ heirs to the time of the death of the life tenant. In its recent decision in Matter of Sayre ( 1 A D 2d 475, affd. 2 N Y 2d 929 ), this court stressed incongruity as one of the “ sound reasons for determining the class of heirs of the testator, not at his death, but at the death of the life tenant ’ ’ ( p. 479 ). The incongruity in our case is greater than that in the Sayre case. The court pointed out in the Sayre case that if the heirs were determined in that case at the death of the testator, the estate of one of the testator ’ s sisters would be allowed to “ qualify for a share as an heir ” even though by an earlier provision a gift to the sister in fee had failed because of her predecease, of the life tenant. Under this construction, the sister ’ s estate would only take a one - sixth share as an heir but even this incongruity was held to be sufficient to militate against the construction which produced it. The court went on to say that ‘ ‘ for all the testator knew when he drew his will, she could have been his only heir at his death, in which case she would have received a vested remainder in fee ”. “ Such an incongruity ’ ’, the court concluded, ‘ ‘ is evidence that the testator did not intend his heirs to be determined at the time of his death ” ( p. 480 ). In our case, the testatrix knew at the time she drew her will that her husband was certain to be her sole distributee as of the time of her death, if he survived her and took the life estate. A wholly incongruous result would be produced by construing the will as giving him the remainder in fee, to take effect upon his death, as well as the life estate. This incongruity is much stronger evidence than the incongruity in the Sayre case that the “ testator [ testatrix ] did not intend * 287his heirs [ her distributees ] to be determined at the time of his [ her ] death ” ( p. 480 ). It is true that the decision in the Sayre case rested not only upon the element of incongruity but also upon the fact that the remainder to the heirs was “ secondary, contingent, and substitutional ” ( p. 480 ). But it is evident from the portion of the opinion discussed above that the court recognized that complete incongruity of the type here present would of itself be sufficient to warrant an inference of an intention to postpone the time of the determination of the testator ’ s heirs to the time of the death of the life tenant. The substitutional nature of the gift was held to be significant in the Sayre case, along with the element of incongruity, only because it furnished a clue to the intention of the testator. The ascertainment of the testator ’ s intention was the objective of the court ’ s inquiry in that case, as it is in all will construction cases. The factors mentioned were relied upon only as evidence of intention. If the intention to postpone the time of the determination of distributees is found, upon a reading of the whole will, it will be given effect, even if the gift to the distributees is primary and not substitutional ( Matter of Sayre, supra, p. 479, citing Matter of Wilson, 294 N. Y. 903, affg. 269 App. Div. 665, which, as to this point, reverses 11 Mise 2d 579 ). The significance of the substitutional and contingent nature of the gift to the testator ’ s heirs in the Sayre case was that it had the effect of postponing to the time of the life tenant ’ s death, the determination of whether the heirs would take at all. This, the court held, tended to support the view that the determination of the identity of the heirs should also be postponed to that time. The provision for the invasion of the principal for the husband ’ s benefit in the will in our case, leaving to the remaindermen only the balance of the principal remaining unexpended on the husband ’ s death, has a similar effect. It is uncertain whether anything will be left on the husband ’ s death. The gift of the remainder is therefore contingent in the sense that, as a practical matter, the effectiveness of the gift depends upon the husband ’ s not using up all the principal for his support during his lifetime. Therefore, under the reasoning of the Sayre case, the determination of the distributees who are to take should also await the end of the life estate. The fact that the gift of the remainder is, in form, a primary gift and not a substitutional gift is immaterial. Indeed, in a case such as ours, where the avoidance of an obvious incongruity is the most important consideration, the fact that the gift to the distributees is a primary gift, instead * 288of a substitutional one, cuts against the respondent ’ s position rather than in his favor. If the gift to distributees had been a substitutional one, it might have been argued that there was in fact no incongruity because the testator may well have intended that the life tenant should take the remainder in - fee, in the event that his first choice, the gift to the primary remainderman, failed. ‘ ‘ If the gift were made ‘ to A for life, and, if B survives A, to B in fee, but if B does not survive A, then to the testator ’ s heirs ’ [ it ] is quite conceivable that the testator might have intended to give the remainder to A if B did not survive A, and therefore the fact that A is the sole heir of the testator at testator ’ s death does not require postponing the determination of heirs to a later date. If the limitations are simply ‘ to A for life, remainder to the testator ’ s heirs, ’ it would be much more difficult to assume that the testator intended A to take the remainder ” ( 2 Simes & Smith on Law of Future Interests [ 2d ed. ], § 735, p. 210 ; cf. Safford v. Kowalik, 278 App. Div. 604 ). Furthermore, in the case of some types of substitutional gifts, it is arguable that the testator expected that in all probability the intervening primary gift would take effect and thus avoid any incongruous result and he may not have cared much that in the remote event of the substitutional gift taking effect, there might be some incongruity. But, in our case, the gift of the remainder to distributees being a primary gift, there was no possibility of the incongruity being avoided by the taking effect of an intervening gift. The incongruity was plainly foreseeable and was certain to occur if the distributees were determined as of the death of the testator. There is much stronger reason for postponing the time of the determination of the distributees in such a case than there is in a case in which the occurrence of the incongruity is a mere possibility or a matter of chance ( Restatement, Property, § 308, comment k, pp. 1716 - 1717 ). Further support for the conclusion here reached is found in Salter v. Drowne ( 205 N. Y. 204, 212 ) ; Stewart v. Giblett ( 235 App. Div. 589 ) ; Matter of Bishop ( 126 Misc. 722, affd. 219 App. Div. 711 ). Matter of Bump ( 234 N. Y. 60 ), principally relied upon by the respondent, will be - found, upon analysis, to support the appellants ’ view rather than the respondent ’ s. While the court in that case reiterated the general rule that the testator ’ s heirs are ordinarily to be determined as of the date of his death, it recognized that that rule is not applicable “ when a contrary intention appears ” ( p. 65 ). In the Bump case, there was a * 289gift of a life estate to the testator ’ s wife with a remainder in fee to his daughter or her issue, if any, surviving the wife ; if none, then a life estate to his sisters or the survivor of them, with a remainder in fee to the testator ’ s heirs. The daughter predeceased the wife, leaving no issue. The question was who was entitled to the remainder in fee. The court found no basis in the will in that case for inferring a contrary intent and hence applied the general rule. The estate of the daughter was held to be entitled to the remainder in fee. The court pointed out, however, that this. was not a completely incongruous result, since the daughter did not take as an heir the whole fee, which she would have taken if she had survived and had taken as a named devisee. “ There is first carved from it the life estate of the sisters and only when that is exhausted does the remainder take effect ” ( p. 64 ). In another part of its opinion, the court indicated even more strongly that if the application of the general rule would have produced a complete incongruity of the type here involved, the court would have found that of itself a sufficient basis for inferring an intention contrary to the general rule. The Surrogate had chosen an intermediate course among the possible constructions of the will and had decided that the testator ’ s heirs should be determined as of the death of the testator ’ s wife, the primary life tenant. As of that time, the sisters were the testator ’ s heirs but the testator had already provided for a life estate for them and it would obviously be incongruous to give them the whole fee in the face of the testator ’ s express limitation of their interest to that of life tenants. The court therefore rejected the Surrogate ’ s construction. “ Is it possible that he intended to designate them by the use of that word [ heirs ] ; that in two succeeding clauses he first carefully provides for a life estate in their favor and then in addition gives them the fee? We think not ” ( p. 64 ). The court thus indicated in the Bump case that it would not adopt a construction of the term ‘ ‘ heirs ’ ’ which would produce the incongruous result of giving the whole remainder to a person whom the testator had specifically limited to a life estate. Of course, as the incongruity is lessened in degree, the force of the reason for avoiding it diminishes ( Restatement, Property, § 308, comment k, p. 1716 ). Thus, for example, if a life estate is devised to one of several heirs of the testator and the remainder is devised to the testator ’ s heirs generally, there is little reason to attribute to the testator an intention to postpone the determination of the class to the time of the life tenant ’ s death. There is little incongruity in allowing the life * 290tenant to take a share of the remainder as one of the heirs of the testator, along with his life estate ( United States Trust Co. v. Taylor, 193 App. Div. 153, affd. 232 N. Y. 609 ; 5 American Law of Property, § 22. 60, p. 445 ). Similarly, even in a case dealing with a sole heir, if the life interest given to him is not an alienable legal life estate but is a life use under a spendthrift trust, it is arguable that there is not sufficient incongruity to require rejection of a construction giving him the remainder in fee. There is no merger of the equitable life use and the remainder ; the life beneficiary cannot terminate the trust, even if he is the sole remainderman ; the trust will still serve its intended purpose. “ [ T ] he purpose of the testator to prevent B [ the life beneficiary ] from having control over the property during his lifetime is not defeated even if B is given the remainder interest ” ( 5 American Law of Property, § 22. 60, p. 444 ; Matter of Roth, 234 App. Div. 474 ). In many of the cases dealing with a gift to heirs, next of kin or distributees, the provision is an end limitation, a sort of catch - all, following a complicated set of dispositions. In that type of case, it may be said that the testator had exhausted his primary purpose and was willing to let the law take its course, if all the preceding dispositions should fail ( Matter of Bump, 234 N. Y. 60, 66, supra ). If an incongruity should then result from the determination of the distributees as of the time of the testator ’ s death, it might well be held that the incongruity should be disregarded on the ground that the testator had had no particular intent in mind at all with respect to the end limitation. But, in this case, the will was a simple one. The gift of the remainder to the testatrix ’ distributees was a part of her primary plan ; it was not a catch - all expression adopted out of exhaustion of purpose or indifference, but a primary gift reflecting a specific intent in the mind of the testatrix as to the disposition of whatever remained of the principal on her husband ’ s death. In this situation, it must be presumed that the testatrix intended to make a logically consistent disposition of her estate and not an incongruous one. All incongruity disappears if the will is construed as providing for the determination of the testatrix ’ distributees as of the time of the death of the life tenant. It must be concluded that that is what the testatrix intended. The decree of the Surrogate should be reversed and the will should be construed as giving the remainder to such persons as may answer the description of distributees of the testatrix at the time of the death of her husband. * 291All concur, except McCurn, P. J., and Kimball, J., who dissent and vote for affirmance in the following memorandum : We all recognize that in construing a will the intent of the testator is the primary object of search. The majority in this case agree that the general rule is that distributees are to be determined as of the date of death of the testator. Here there is nothing, as we view it, which impels a departure from the general rule. The conclusion that the testatrix did not intend that her husband who survived her should take the remainder interest but that such remainder should go to relatives of the half blood, ascertainable upon her husband ’ s death, is a pure assumption and surmise as to what the testatrix intended. She used words of a present gift of the remainder which became vested upon her death, subject only to the life use of the husband. There are, in the will, no words of a future gift as to the remainder. The gift of the remainder was direct and primary. It was not substitutional. It was not contingent upon some future event. The only uncertainty was the amount. The vesting of estates is favored by the law. The general rule ‘ ‘ is not affected by the fact that a life estate precedes the gift of the remainder ; and, a life tenant may be the recipient of the remainder ” ( Safford, v. Kowalik, 278 App. Div. 604, and cases there cited ). We find nothing in the will which justifies the finding of fact as to the intent of the testatrix necessary to sustain the position taken by the majority. We prefer to adhere to the established rules which the courts of this State have established. ( Matter of Bump, 234 N. Y. 60 ; Matter of White, 213 App. Div. 82. ) The case of Matter of Sayre in this court ( 1 A D 2d 475 ) is readily distinguishable on the facts. Present — McCubn, P. J., Kimball, Williams, Bastow and Halperm, JJ. Decree reversed on the law and facts and matter remitted to the Surrogate ’ s Court for entry of a decree in accordance with the opinion. The petition for the probate of the will, which is referred to in the opinion below but is not printed in the record, shows that the testatrix was 61 years of age at the time of her death in 1944, so she was 52 years of age at the time of the execution of the will.",5702250," Halpern, J. This is an appeal from a decree of the Surrogate’s Court of Genesee County in a will construction proceeding which held that the surviving husband of the testatrix, Sarah M. Carlin, “ is the sole distributee of Sarah M. Carlin, deceased, and thereby entitled not only to the life use of the entire property of said deceased, but also to the gift and bequest of the remainder interest as well ’’. The will is very short. The donative provisions are as follows: ‘‘ First. After the payment of all my just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, I give, devise and bequeath the use of all my property, real and personal, to my husband, Walter T. Carlin and give him the privilege in case of necessity to use so much of the principal as may be necessary for his care and support. “ Upon the death of my husband, I give, devise and bequeath such of my property as shall then remain to my distributees under the laws of the State of New York.” Analyzing these provisions, we find a clearly expressed testamentary scheme. The testatrix intended (1) to give her husband the income from her estate for life; (2) to give him a limited right to invade the principal “ in case of necessity ” to *283provide for his care and support; (3) to give so much of the principal as remained upon his death to the testatrix’ distributees. The will was executed on March 9, 1935. The testatrix died on October 13,1944. Both at the time of the execution of the will and at the time of the death of the testatrix, the testatrix’ husband was her closest relative under the statutory table of distribution and he would be her sole distributee, if her distributees were determined as of that time. The testatrix also left her surviving an uncle and cousins, the survivors of whom would be her distributees, if her distributees were determined as of the time of the death of her husband. The testatrix had never had any children and, at the time of the execution of the will, there was no reason to believe that she would have any before her death*; she had never had brothers or sisters and her parents were dead. Therefore, there was no possibility of anyone other than her husband being her distributee, if her distributees were determined as of the time of her death, provided only that he survived her. In this situation, the inference is inescapable that the testatrix must have intended that the remainder should go to the persons who would be her distributees at the time of the death of her husband rather than at her own death. In making a gift ‘ ‘ to my distributees ’ ’ of what remained ‘ ‘ upon the death of my husband ’ ’, she must have meant the persons who would be her nearest relatives as of that time. This is the only construction which is consistent with the testamentary scheme expressed in the will. If the will were construed as requiring the determination of the distributees as of the time of the death of the testatrix, the result produced Avould be a Avholly incongruous one. The testatrix’ husband would then be the sole distributee and he would take the remainder as well as the life estate. The life estate Avould merge with the remainder in fee and the husband would acquire at once a present fee simple absolute, notwithstanding the clearly expressed intention of the testatrix to limit his legal interest to that of a life tenant. Every aspect of the testamentary scheme would be frustrated if the will were construed as giving the husband a fee simple *284absolute. The provision giving the' husband a. limited power to use .the principal in case of necessity would be rendered meaningless by this construction. As the owner of .the fee, the husband could, of course,. expend the principal as he pleased. There would be then no need for a provision giving him a “ privilege ” to use the principal. Neither would the limitation on the privilege be effective. As the sole owner of the estate, the.husband would be in.a position to expend or dissipate the principal at once, without regard to the amount currently needed for his support, even though this left him without any income during the rest of his life. The salutary purpose of the testatrix to protect her husband against his own improvidence would thus be defeated. Furthermore, under the construction vesting the whole fee in the husband, he would be able to give or bequeath the property to relatives of his own or to strangers, thus defeating the testatrix’ expressed intention that whatever remained on his death should go to “ my distributees ’’. Presumably, by this term she meant her own relatives. It is significant that while the husband was given the power to invade the principal during his lifetime, to the extent necessary for his care and support, he was not given any power to appoint the principal by will or, in any other manner, to dispose of the unconsumed balance of the principal on his death. This restriction would likewise be nullified by construing the will as giving the husband the whole fee. • The gift of the remainder to the testatrix’ distributees is stated in the will in terms of á gift of whatever balance remains upon the husband’s death after he has used as much of the principal as . necessary. This formulation necessarily implies that the balance is to be paid over to some one other than the husband. Whether, there will.be any balance and, if so, how much, cannot be determined until the husband’s death. It is therefore reasonable to infer that, under the testamentary scheme, the distributees are also to be determined as of that time. .On the other hand, it is wholly unreasonable to attribute to the testatrix an intention to give to her husband a fee by the circuitous method of giving him a life estate by name and then giving him the remainder by describing him as her “ distributees ”. If the testatrix, had intended to, give her husband the whole fee, she could readily have so provided in a few simple words. There was no possible reason for the circumlocution. *285It is hornbook law that the touchstone in all will construction cases is the intention of the testator, as ascertained from the language of the will, read as a whole in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of its execution (Spencer v. Childs, 1 N Y 2d 103, 107). The testator’s intent “ must be gleaned * * * from a sympathetic reading of the will as an entirety and in view of all the facts and circumstances under which the provisions of the will were framed ” (Matter of Fabbri, 2 N Y 2d 236, 240). “ The intention of the testatrix, so long as it is not contrary to some statute or to public policy, must govern ’ ’ (Salter v. Browne, 205 F. Y. 204, 212). Since the intention of the testatrix in this case is self-evident, the only question which need concern us is whether there is any rule of law Avhich prevents us from carrying out her intention. We can find no such rule in the authorities. It is true that there is a general rule to the effect that a testator’s distributees are ordinarily to be determined as of the time of his death but this rule ‘ ‘ is not a rule of substantive law, but a rule of interpretation, which has been adopted by the courts as one means of ascertaining the intention of the testator as expressed in the will; and it never should be used to defeat what, from the whole will, appears with reasonable certainty to have been his intention ” (57 Am. Jur., Wills, § 1279, p. 848). When a gift is made to persons “to be determined by a statute governing the intestate succession of property, then the statute is applied as of the death of the designated ancestor, unless an intent of the conveyor to have the statute applied as of some other date is found from additional language or circumstances ” (Bestatement, Property, § 308). In our case, the intent of the testatrix to postpone the determination of her distributees to the time of the death of the life tenant is readily inferable from the “ additional language ” of the will in this case and from the “ circumstances ” at the time of its execution. In a comment to the section quoted, the American Law Institute takes the view that where, a testator gives a life estate to a person who is presumptively his sole heir and then gives the remainder in terms to his “heirs ”, the incongruity which would result from determining the heirs as of the time of the testator’s death is of itself sufficient to warrant an inference of an intention to postpone the time of the determination of the testator’s heirs to the death of the life tenant. ‘‘ When A, by will, conveys property ‘ to B for life then to my heirs’ and B is the sole *286heir of A * * * the fact that * * * B is the sole heir of A at the death of A tends to establish that A intended his heirs to be ascertained as of the death of B, so that B is prevented from sharing in the limitation to the heirs of A” (Restatement, Property, § 308, comment k). To the same effect, see American Law of Property (vol. 5, § 22.60, pp. 441-443). As we have seen, in our case there is a much greater incongruity than that resulting from a construction which gives the remainder in fee to a sole heir who had theretofore been given a life estate. There is the additional incongruity which grows out of the fact that the testatrix had expressly given the life tenant a limited power to invade the principal to the extent necessary for his care and support; this provision is wholly incongruous with a construction which gives the remainder in fee to the life tenant. This basic incongruity can be escaped only by postponing the time of the determination of the testatrix’ heirs to the time of the death of the life tenant. In its recent decision in Matter of Sayre (1 A D 2d 475, affd. 2 N Y 2d 929), this court stressed incongruity as one of the “ sound reasons for determining the class of heirs of the testator, not at his death, but at the death of the life tenant ’’ (p. 479). The incongruity in our case is greater than that in the Sayre case. The court pointed out in the Sayre case that if the heirs were determined in that case at the death of the testator, the estate of one of the testator’s sisters would be allowed to “ qualify for a share as an heir ” even though by an earlier provision a gift to the sister in fee had failed because of her predecease, of the life tenant. Under this construction, the sister’s estate would only take a one-sixth share as an heir but even this incongruity was held to be sufficient to militate against the construction which produced it. The court went on to say that ‘‘ for all the testator knew when he drew his will, she could have been his only heir at his death, in which case she would have received a vested remainder in fee ”. “ Such an incongruity ’ ’, the court concluded, ‘ ‘ is evidence that the testator did not intend his heirs to be determined at the time of his death ” (p. 480). In our case, the testatrix knew at the time she drew her will that her husband was certain to be her sole distributee as of the time of her death, if he survived her and took the life estate. A wholly incongruous result would be produced by construing the will as giving him the remainder in fee, to take effect upon his death, as well as the life estate. This incongruity is much stronger evidence than the incongruity in the Sayre case that the “ testator [testatrix] did not intend *287his heirs [her distributees] to be determined at the time of his [her] death ” (p. 480). It is true that the decision in the Sayre case rested not only upon the element of incongruity but also upon the fact that the remainder to the heirs was “ secondary, contingent, and substitutional ” (p. 480). But it is evident from the portion of the opinion discussed above that the court recognized that complete incongruity of the type here present would of itself be sufficient to warrant an inference of an intention to postpone the time of the determination of the testator’s heirs to the time of the death of the life tenant. The substitutional nature of the gift was held to be significant in the Sayre case, along with the element of incongruity, only because it furnished a clue to the intention of the testator. The ascertainment of the testator’s intention was the objective of the court’s inquiry in that case, as it is in all will construction cases. The factors mentioned were relied upon only as evidence of intention. If the intention to postpone the time of the determination of distributees is found, upon a reading of the whole will, it will be given effect, even if the gift to the distributees is primary and not substitutional (Matter of Sayre, supra, p. 479, citing Matter of Wilson, 294 N. Y. 903, affg. 269 App. Div. 665, which, as to this point, reverses 11 Mise 2d 579). The significance of the substitutional and contingent nature of the gift to the testator’s heirs in the Sayre case was that it had the effect of postponing to the time of the life tenant’s death, the determination of whether the heirs would take at all. This, the court held, tended to support the view that the determination of the identity of the heirs should also be postponed to that time. The provision for the invasion of the principal for the husband’s benefit in the will in our case, leaving to the remaindermen only the balance of the principal remaining unexpended on the husband’s death, has a similar effect. It is uncertain whether anything will be left on the husband’s death. The gift of the remainder is therefore contingent in the sense that, as a practical matter, the effectiveness of the gift depends upon the husband’s not using up all the principal for his support during his lifetime. Therefore, under the reasoning of the Sayre case, the determination of the distributees who are to take should also await the end of the life estate. The fact that the gift of the remainder is, in form, a primary gift and not a substitutional gift is immaterial. Indeed, in a case such as ours, where the avoidance of an obvious incongruity is the most important consideration, the fact that the gift to the distributees is a primary gift, instead *288of a substitutional one, cuts against the respondent’s position rather than in his favor. If the gift to distributees had been a substitutional one, it might have been argued that there was in fact no incongruity because the testator may well have intended that the life tenant should take the remainder in- fee, in the event that his first choice, the gift to the primary remainderman, failed. ‘‘ If the gift were made ‘ to A for life, and, if B survives A, to B in fee, but if B does not survive A, then to the testator’s heirs ’ [it] is quite conceivable that the testator might have intended to give the remainder to A if B did not survive A, and therefore the fact that A is the sole heir of the testator at testator’s death does not require postponing the determination of heirs to a later date. If the limitations are simply ‘ to A for life, remainder to the testator’s heirs,’ it would be much more difficult to assume that the testator intended A to take the remainder ” (2 Simes & Smith on Law of Future Interests [2d ed.], § 735, p. 210; cf. Safford v. Kowalik, 278 App. Div. 604). Furthermore, in the case of some types of substitutional gifts, it is arguable that the testator expected that in all probability the intervening primary gift would take effect and thus avoid any incongruous result and he may not have cared much that in the remote event of the substitutional gift taking effect, there might be some incongruity. But, in our case, the gift of the remainder to distributees being a primary gift, there was no possibility of the incongruity being avoided by the taking effect of an intervening gift. The incongruity was plainly foreseeable and was certain to occur if the distributees were determined as of the death of the testator. There is much stronger reason for postponing the time of the determination of the distributees in such a case than there is in a case in which the occurrence of the incongruity is a mere possibility or a matter of chance (Restatement, Property, § 308, comment k, pp. 1716-1717). Further support for the conclusion here reached is found in Salter v. Drowne (205 N. Y. 204, 212); Stewart v. Giblett (235 App. Div. 589); Matter of Bishop (126 Misc. 722, affd. 219 App. Div. 711). Matter of Bump (234 N. Y. 60), principally relied upon by the respondent, will be- found, upon analysis, to support the appellants’ view rather than the respondent’s. While the court in that case reiterated the general rule that the testator’s heirs are ordinarily to be determined as of the date of his death, it recognized that that rule is not applicable “when a contrary intention appears” (p. 65). In the Bump case, there was a *289gift of a life estate to the testator’s wife with a remainder in fee to his daughter or her issue, if any, surviving the wife; if none, then a life estate to his sisters or the survivor of them, with a remainder in fee to the testator’s heirs. The daughter predeceased the wife, leaving no issue. The question was who was entitled to the remainder in fee. The court found no basis in the will in that case for inferring a contrary intent and hence applied the general rule. The estate of the daughter was held to be entitled to the remainder in fee. The court pointed out, however, that this. was not a completely incongruous result, since the daughter did not take as an heir the whole fee, which she would have taken if she had survived and had taken as a named devisee. “ There is first carved from it the life estate of the sisters and only when that is exhausted does the remainder take effect ” (p. 64). In another part of its opinion, the court indicated even more strongly that if the application of the general rule would have produced a complete incongruity of the type here involved, the court would have found that of itself a sufficient basis for inferring an intention contrary to the general rule. The Surrogate had chosen an intermediate course among the possible constructions of the will and had decided that the testator’s heirs should be determined as of the death of the testator’s wife, the primary life tenant. As of that time, the sisters were the testator’s heirs but the testator had already provided for a life estate for them and it would obviously be incongruous to give them the whole fee in the face of the testator’s express limitation of their interest to that of life tenants. The court therefore rejected the Surrogate’s construction. “Is it possible that he intended to designate them by the use of that word [heirs]; that in two succeeding clauses he first carefully provides for a life estate in their favor and then in addition gives them the fee? We think not ” (p. 64). The court thus indicated in the Bump case that it would not adopt a construction of the term ‘ ‘ heirs ’ ’ which would produce the incongruous result of giving the whole remainder to a person whom the testator had specifically limited to a life estate. Of course, as the incongruity is lessened in degree, the force of the reason for avoiding it diminishes (Restatement, Property, § 308, comment k, p. 1716). Thus, for example, if a life estate is devised to one of several heirs of the testator and the remainder is devised to the testator’s heirs generally, there is little reason to attribute to the testator an intention to postpone the determination of the class to the time of the life tenant’s death. There is little incongruity in allowing the life *290tenant to take a share of the remainder as one of the heirs of the testator, along with his life estate (United States Trust Co. v. Taylor, 193 App. Div. 153, affd. 232 N. Y. 609; 5 American Law of Property, § 22.60, p. 445). Similarly, even in a case dealing with a sole heir, if the life interest given to him is not an alienable legal life estate but is a life use under a spendthrift trust, it is arguable that there is not sufficient incongruity to require rejection of a construction giving him the remainder in fee. There is no merger of the equitable life use and the remainder; the life beneficiary cannot terminate the trust, even if he is the sole remainderman ; the trust will still serve its intended purpose. “ [T]he purpose of the testator to prevent B [the life beneficiary] from having control over the property during his lifetime is not defeated even if B is given the remainder interest ” (5 American Law of Property, § 22.60, p. 444; Matter of Roth, 234 App. Div. 474). In many of the cases dealing with a gift to heirs, next of kin or distributees, the provision is an end limitation, a sort of catch-all, following a complicated set of dispositions. In that type of case, it may be said that the testator had exhausted his primary purpose and was willing to let the law take its course, if all the preceding dispositions should fail (Matter of Bump, 234 N. Y. 60, 66, supra). If an incongruity should then result from the determination of the distributees as of the time of the testator’s death, it might well be held that the incongruity should be disregarded on the ground that the testator had had no particular intent in mind at all with respect to the end limitation. But, in this case, the will was a simple one. The gift of the remainder to the testatrix’ distributees was a part of her primary plan; it was not a catch-all expression adopted out of exhaustion of purpose or indifference, but a primary gift reflecting a specific intent in the mind of the testatrix as to the disposition of whatever remained of the principal on her husband’s death. In this situation, it must be presumed that the testatrix intended to make a logically consistent disposition of her estate and not an incongruous one. All incongruity disappears if the will is construed as providing for the determination of the testatrix’ distributees as of the time of the death of the life tenant. It must be concluded that that is what the testatrix intended. The decree of the Surrogate should be reversed and the will should be construed as giving the remainder to such persons as may answer the description of distributees of the testatrix at the time of the death of her husband. *291All concur, except McCurn, P. J., and Kimball, J., who dissent and vote for affirmance in the following memorandum: We all recognize that in construing a will the intent of the testator is the primary object of search.

The learned judge thought, inasmuch as the office of coroner is a judicial office, and the holding of an inquest a judicial inquiry, therefore this evidence was inadmissible.

The defendant, Lewis G. Dailey, a son of W. H. Dailey, is the surviving member of the partnership. The action was brought to obtain an accounting of the affairs of the partnership. The defendant filed with the referee, appointed to take and state the accounts, a statement of account showing a balance of partnership assets over liabilities of $ 3, 576. 76. The referee surcharged the defendant with various items totalling $ 872. 49, and credited him with $ 12, 337, for the value of sand and gravel furnished to the partnership from certain lands, known as the Wilbur lots, to which the defendant had title. The referee ’ s report was confirmed and an interlocutory judgment, based upon the report, was entered. The plaintiff then appealed. The sole question raised is whether or not the defendant was entitled to the credit of $ 12, 337 allowed to him by the referee. William H. Dailey and his son, the defendant Lewis G. Dailey, were engaged as partners in a sand and gravel business. The business consisted of excavating sand and gravel from vacant land and marketing the same. William H. Dailey had been in the business for several years. Lewis G. Dailey had been doing railroad work. In July, 1919, the father persuaded the son to come and work with him. Articles of copartnership were not signed until September 27, 1919, but according to the testimony of Lewis G. Dailey, the two were “ working together in this same business ” before that time. Early in July the father, William "" H. Dailey, negotiated for the purchase of the so - called Wilbur lots. On July 12, 1919, he purchased the same for $ 2, 500. The father gave his check to the seller for $ 1, 000. The premises were deeded to Lewis G. Dailey who gave back a bond of $ 1, 500, secured by a mortgage on the lots, to secure the balance of the purchase price. Thereafter, until the death of William H. Dailey in November, 1921, sand and gravel were excavated from the lots and marketed by the partner * 320ship. Twelve thousand, three hundred and thirty - seven cubic yards were so excavated. The material, before excavation, was of the value of one dollar per cubic yard. The sand and gravel thus excavated by the firm are the basis of the credit allowed to Lewis G. Dailey. There was no evidence of any express contract entered info by the firm with Lewis G. Dailey for the purchase of the material. The referee based his allowance of the credit upon the simple fact that the title to the lands from which the excavations were made was in Lewis G. Dailey. He held that there was no trust interest in the lands held by William H. Dailey because of the consideration in part paid by him. While this is undoubtedly true it does not conclude the matter. The plaintiff is not seeking an interest in the Wilbur lots. She is merely defending against a claim that gravel and sand, excavated from the lots and marketed by the firm, had been sold, the firm by Lewis G. Dailey. The proof requires no such inference. On the contrary, it sanctions, with greater propriety, the inference that the sand and gravel were furnished free of charge. William H. Dailey and Lewis G. Dailey were father and son. They were partners in a sand ' and gravel business. Lewis G. Dailey had the legal title to the Wilbur gravel and sand lots. However, the only cash furnished for the purchase of the lots was provided by William H. Dailey. It is a natural assumption that the partners excavated the lots, to provide material for their business, as if the lands were jointly owned, without thought of a credit to the partner having legál title. This assumption is borne out by several significant items of proof. No account of the excavated material was kept either by the firm or by Lewis G. Dailey. No credit was given on the firm books to Lewis G. Dailey for the material taken. No charge therefor was made upon any books of account kept by Lewis G. Dailey and no bill for the material was ever rendered to the firm. The plaintiff in her complaint alleged that, at the death of William H. Dailey, the firm had assets amounting to $ 6, 101. 50, and “ that as against said assets the said firm had liabilities, which to the best of plaintiff ’ s knowledge and belief did not exceed $ 934. 50. ” These allegations were not denied by the defendant in his answer. On the contrary, he filed with the referee a statement of account showing a balance of partnership assets over liabilities of $ 3, 576. 76. Had the firm purchased the gravel and sand from the Wilbur lots its liabilities would have exceeded its assets by more than $ 8, 000. Moreover, in the account so filed, the defendant, instead of crediting himself with the sand and gravel furnished, actually debits himself as owing the firm the sum of $ 138. It seems to us that his subsequent claim, made * 321in the course of the hearings before the referee, that he was a creditor of the firm for a sum greater than $ 12, 000, was entirely an afterthought. We think it was not made at an earlier stage in the proceedings for the reason that he had always considered the fact to be that sand and gravel furnished from the Wilbur lots were supplied free of charge, precisely as if the lots had been partnership property. We think the evidence conclusive that such was indeed the fact and that Lewis G. Dailey was not entitled to the credit allowed. The judgment should be modified by eliminating the credit to the defendant of $ 12, 337, and as modified affirmed, with costs to the appellant. Interlocutory judgment modified by eliminating the credit to the defendant of $ 12, 337, and as modified unanimously affirmed, with costs to the appellant. The court disapproves of findings third, fourth and seventh of the judgment in so far as they find that the defendant contributed to the firm material of the value of $ 12, 337, and of all the calculations made in the various findings based upon a credit to the defendant for such an amount. It affirmatively finds that the material furnished from lands to which the defendant has title was supplied free of charge according to the mutual understanding of the partners.",5291417," H. T.

9636547_1,1743,"OLSZEWSKI, Judge : Appellant Patricia Kemether was involved in an automobile accident in December 1990. She alleged that she was forced off the road by a large truck approaching on her side of the road. Immediately after the accident, Patricia identified the truck as an Agway truck. After investigation, however, Patricia concluded that the vehicle was not an Agway truck, but was a “ phantom ” or unidentified vehicle. On this basis, Patricia and her husband notified appellee Aetna of their insurance claim under the uninsured motorist clause of their policy. Based on Patricia ’ s initial identification of the vehicle as an Agway truck, Aetna claimed that it was not a “ phantom ” vehicle, and therefore was not covered under the uninsured motorist terms of the policy. Seeking a determination of liability, Aetna filed suit for declaratory judgment against the Kemethers and Agway. The trial court dismissed the action and referred the matter to arbitration, under the specific terms of the policy, in order to determine if the truck in question was a “ phantom ” or unidentified vehicle. On October 18, 1993, the arbitrators issued an award in favor of Aetna, finding that the Kemethers had failed to prove that the accident was the result of a “ phantom ” vehicle. The Kemethers filed a petition to modify or vacate award of arbitrators, which was denied by the trial court by Order dated April 11, 1994. This appeal followed. Initially, Aetna asserts that this appeal must be quashed, as no appeal lies from an order denying a petition to vacate or modify. Aetna is correct in noting that an order * 471denying a petition to vacate or modify is not an appealable order under section 7320 ( a ). 42 Pa. C. S. A. § 7320 ( a ). See also Dunlap by Hoffman v. State Farm Ins., 377 Pa. Super. 165, 169, 546 A. 2d 1209, 1211 ( 1988 ). The proper procedure is for the court to enter an order confirming the arbitrators ’ award, either simultaneously with or following the entry of the order denying the petition to vacate or modify. Id. It is from this confirming order that an appeal lies. While no such confirming order was entered in the instant case, we find that it would be inappropriate to quash the appeal. The responsibility for entering a confirming order in such a case lies with the trial judge, not the appellant. In Dunlap, this Court found that it would not be proper to quash an appeal where no confirming order was entered after the denial of a petition to vacate. 377 Pa. Super. at 169, 546 A. 2d at 1211. We wrote : [ Ojnce appellant ’ s petition to set aside i. e. vacate was denied, it was not appellant ’ s obligation to file an application to confirm the award denying appellant recovery, but, rather, the obligation of the trial court to enter an order confirming the award simultaneously with the order denying appellant ’ s petition to set aside. Id. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the trial court to enter an order confirming the award, and the Kemethers will not be punished for the trial court ’ s failure to enter the required order. After determining that quashal was not appropriate, the Dunlap court remanded to the trial court so that the correct order could be entered and reduced to judgment. 377 Pa. Super. at 169, 546 A. 2d at 1211. We find such a remand unnecessary in the present case. In Dunlap, the order denying the petition to vacate was never reduced to judgment. Id. Without any order that was reduced to judgment, we simply could not address the appeal. Id. Unlike Dunlap, we do have a judgment in the instant appeal. 1 While it is a judg * 472ment on the order denying the petition to vacate or modify, it is nonetheless a final judgment. The record fails to reveal, and no party suggests, any reason why the award should not have been confirmed after the trial court denied the petition to vacate or modify. Therefore, no purpose at all would be served by a remand to confirm the award, reduce that order to judgment, and bring the appeal right back to this Court. See Popskyj v. Keystone Ins. Co., 388 Pa. Super. 429, 432 n. 1, 565 A. 2d 1184, 1186 n. 1 ( 1989 ) ( addressing the merits of an appeal taken from the denial of a petition to vacate or modify and refusing to remand for the “ ministerial act ” of entering a confirming order ). Thus, notwithstanding the procedural irregularity, we will address the merits of this appeal. In the proceedings below, the trial court refused to address the issues raised in the Kemethers ’ petition to vacate or modify award of arbitrators. The trial court applied Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1307 ( d ), which provides for very limited review of arbitration awards. In the explanatory note to section ( d ), it states that if a party is unhappy with an award, the sole remedy is an appeal for a trial de novo. It is only in limited situations where there are obvious mathematical or language errors that the trial court can modify or vacate an award without a trial de novo. Pa. R. C. P. 1307 ( d ). Since the Kemethers petitioned to vacate or modify rather than for a trial de novo, and their claims did not involve obvious mathematical or language errors, the trial court denied the petition without addressing the Kemethers ’ claims. While the trial court correctly read Pa. R. C. P. 1307 ( d ), it incorrectly applied that rule to this case. The Kemethers ’ claim against Aetna is brought under an insurance contract, which specifically states that arbitration will be in accordance with the provisions of the Pennsylvania Uniform Arbitration Act. R. R. 53a - 54a. Since this contract is in writing and expressly provides for arbitration under the provisions of the Uniform Arbitration Act, it is presumed to provide for statutory arbitration pursuant to subchapter A. See 42 Pa. C. S. A. § 7302 ( d ) ; Cigna Ins. Co. v. Squires, 427 Pa. Super. 206, 208, 628 A. 2d 899, 900 ( 1993 ). Under the * 473provisions of this subchapter, an appealing party must petition the court to vacate or modify the award. 42 Pa. C. S. A. § § 7314 and 7315. In contrast, Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1307 ( d ), which requires an appeal by a trial de novo, only applies to actions which are submitted to compulsory arbitration pursuant to subchapter C. Therefore, we find that the trial judge incorrectly applied Pa. R. C. P. 1307 ( d ) to the present case. Under subchapter A statutory arbitration, a party may appeal an award by filing a petition to vacate or modify the award pursuant to 42 Pa. C. S. A. § § 7314 and 7315. The Kemethers filed the correct petition in accordance with the statute. Therefore, the trial court should have addressed the issues raised in the petition to vacate or modify. Since the trial court failed to address the properly raised claims of error, we must remand to the trial court and order it to hear the facts, make findings on the record, and rule on the claims of error.

5720288_1,801,"Rose, J. Appeal from a decision of the Workers ’ Compensation Board, filed August 17, 2005, which ruled that claimant did not sustain a causally related occupational disease and denied his claim for workers ’ compensation benefits. Claimant, a laborer, ceased working for his employer of two years in May 2002 when he began experiencing back pain. One month later, he submitted an application for disability benefits in which he averred that his disability was due to a disc herniation that occurred at home while he was coughing, and his chiropractor indicated that his disability was not an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of his employment. As a result of that application, claimant was awarded disability benefits for the time period between May 29, 2002 and December 3, 2002. Notwithstanding such award, claimant submitted a claim for workers ’ compensation benefits in November 2002, maintaining that his back injury was an occupational disease caused by the “ constant bending, stooping and heavy lifting ” associated with his job. Following a hearing, during which only claimant and his employer offered testimony, a Workers ’ Compensation Law Judge ( hereinafter WCLJ ) determined that claimant ’ s back injury was work related and established his claim. Upon review, * 923the Workers ’ Compensation Board rescinded the decision of the WCLJ and directed that the case be restored to the trial calendar for development of the record on the issue of causal relationship, with claimant to produce “ medical evidence relating to his disability claim, as well as any prior medical treatment for [ his ] back. ” Upon consideration of the medical opinions subsequently provided by physicians for both claimant and the employer, a WCLJ concluded that the record lacked evidence to support a finding of occupational disease, notice or causal relationship, and disallowed the claim.

Appeal from a decision of the Workers’ Compensation Board, filed August 17, 2005, which ruled that claimant did not sustain a causally related occupational disease and denied his claim for workers’ compensation benefits. Claimant, a laborer, ceased working for his employer of two years in May 2002 when he began experiencing back pain. One month later, he submitted an application for disability benefits in which he averred that his disability was due to a disc herniation that occurred at home while he was coughing, and his chiropractor indicated that his disability was not an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of his employment. As a result of that application, claimant was awarded disability benefits for the time period between May 29, 2002 and December 3, 2002. Notwithstanding such award, claimant submitted a claim for workers’ compensation benefits in November 2002, maintaining that his back injury was an occupational disease caused by the “constant bending, stooping and heavy lifting” associated with his job. Following a hearing, during which only claimant and his employer offered testimony, a Workers’ Compensation Law Judge (hereinafter WCLJ) determined that claimant’s back injury was work related and established his claim. Upon review, *923the Workers’ Compensation Board rescinded the decision of the WCLJ and directed that the case be restored to the trial calendar for development of the record on the issue of causal relationship, with claimant to produce “medical evidence relating to his disability claim, as well as any prior medical treatment for [his] back.” Upon consideration of the medical opinions subsequently provided by physicians for both claimant and the employer, a WCLJ concluded that the record lacked evidence to support a finding of occupational disease, notice or causal relationship, and disallowed the claim. That decision was affirmed by the Board, prompting this appeal by claimant. We affirm. Despite his initial denials, a review of the record reveals that claimant had previously been treated for back pain. When questioned about the MRI he had undergone in 1997, claimant admitted that he suffered a herniated disc, but maintained that “it [was] not the same disc as now.” In contrast, the carrier’s medical expert, who reviewed claimant’s MRIs from both 1997 and 2002, opined that claimant’s May 2002 back ailment “was an aggravation of a preexisting condition, which does not appear to have been due to a specific work-related incident in May of 200[2].”* Furthermore, although afforded the opportunity to produce medical evidence supporting his contention that his present injury was not related to his prior condition, claimant was unable to recall the name of his treating physician in 1997 and did not present the Board with the medical records relating to his disability claim.

5195691_1,1816,"Hatch, J. : A brief history of the proceedings which have been had in connection with the present proceeding is essential to an understanding of the question presented by this appeal. The plaintiffs herein brought an action to recover a considerable sum of money in which the appellant, the judgment debtor herein, Judson, Jolm R. Drexel and Joseph Leiter were named as defendants. Therein an order was obtained for the examination of the appellant before trial to enable the plaintiffs to properly frame a complaint. Under that order the plaintiffs sought to compel the appellant to produce his books for examination, but the application was denied. Thereafter the plaintiffs brought an action against the defendant Judson and obtained a judgment against him by default for $ 7, 512. 08. Execution was issued thereon and returned wholly unsatisfied and there * 324upon proceedings supplementary to execution were instituted upon that judgment. Therein the appellant was served with a subpmna duces tecum. to appear before a justice of the Supreme Court, to be examined as a witness in the last - named proceeding. Thereupon the appellant moved to vacate the subpoena, which motion was denied at the Special Term. An appeal was taken from the order entered thereon to this court and resulted in the affirmance of the order. The opinion delivered in deciding the motion was written by Presiding Justice Van Brunt and was concurred in by all of the other members of the court. ( 96 App. Div. 601. ) Therein the court said : “ This appeal seems to proceed upon the theory that the subpoena requires the appellant ( the witness ) to produce his books and papers for the plaintiffs ’ inspection. The subpoena does not so read nor is such its office. The appellant can he subpoenaed to produce his books only so that he can by reference to them answer questions pertinent to the inquiry being conducted before the court. It gives no right whatever to the inspection of the books by the plaintiffs ’ counsel. It ' is claimed that the books are to be used for the purpose of getting evidence in respect to other litigations and not for any purpose connected with the examination before the court. The court before which the examination is pending will see that it is limited to the subjects germane to the investigation being carried on ; and we ' cannot say that the court will not perform its duty in this respect. Indeed we believe that it will ; and that the examination will be conductedly solely with a view to a discovery of property of the defendant, and not for discovery of evidence relating to another controversy. The rights of the witness can and undoubtedly will be completely protected by the court below. ” After this decision the witness appeared before the court in obedience to the subpoena and produced his books. The course of the investigation sought to disclose the existence of a combination or pool entered into between the appellant with Judson and others for the purpose of controlling the market price of International Power Company stock. By reason of such arrangement it was claimed that Judson had acquired rights of much value and the particular proceedings of this combination were sought to be developed by the examination of the witness. The books having been produced, the attention of the witness was directed to the account therein con * 325cerning the transaction and repeated questions concerning the knowledge of the witness with respect thereto were asked, and in almost every instance the witness testified that he knew nothing about the entries ; that he was unable to state the particulars concerning them and that they did not in any respect refresh his recollection so that he was able to give the details of the transaction to which the entries related. He excused himself for his inability to answer in this respect by stating that the entries were not made by him, nor under his direction, but by a bookkeeper under the direction of other persons. The course of the examination clearly disclosed one of two conditions ; either that the witness willfully refused to recollect the particulars of the transaction or that he was unable to refresh his memory from anything which appeared in the books. Counsel for the plaintiffs asked the witness to read the entries in the books and the witness refused, for the reason that he was not commanded by the subpoena so to do. The court was evidently impressed with the view that the witness was not acting in good faith in his denial of recollection of the particulars of the transaction and of his inability to refresh his recollection from the books. In passing upon the question of the refusal of the witness to answer the question and read from the books the court said : “ In view of his avowed ignorance of these matters I think I shall require him to state the amounts of the items. I propose to give Mr. Mooney whatever information the book may impart as long as the witness is unable to furnish any additional information. ” Thereupon the examination proceeded and the witness read from the books quite a large number of items. After proceeding for some time along this line counsel for the plaintiffs asked the following question : “ Q. State whether you find under the dates of October or November, 1900, an item of 1, 700 shares put up by you in one lot or in a number of lots in connection with this pool? ” Appellant ’ s counsel objected to the question as not within the scope of the examination, as calling for the contents of a book, which under this proceeding the judgment creditors had no right to ask for or to obtain, and that the question called for an inspection of the contents of the books. The witness refused to answer, and the court for such refusal adjudged the witness to be in contempt and made the order front which this appeal is taken, * 326The decision of this court upon the former appeal stated the particular office of the subpoena and in clear terms announced that it gave no. right to the inspection of the books by the plaintiffs ’ counsel upon the examination. It is evident that the ruling of the court in directing the witness to give the items appearing in the book and the question which the witness refused to answer, and for which he has been adjudged to be in contempt, exceeded the limitation placed by this court upon the plaintiffs ’ right. It gave to • the plaintiffs for all practical purposes an inspection of the books. There is no practical difference between the physical possession and inspection of the contents of the books and compelling the witness to read the items contained therein. Such an examination when finished would have displayed in the record, not the recollection of the witness, but the contents of the books, and such right had been denied to the plaintiffs by two decisions of this court : First, upon the application to examine the appellant in order to frame the complaint ( 82 App. Div. 636 ) and, second, upon the motion to vacate the subpoena. Whatever may be plaintiffs ’ rights to procure an inspection of these books upon a proper application, it is settled by the adjudication of this court that he cannot have such inspection upon the examination in this proceeding, and the sole purpose of this question was directed to obtaining the contents of the books. It was, therefore, clearly improper. It is no answer to say that the witness was guilty of bad faith and falsified when he stated that he had no recollection of what the entries meant ; that his memory was not refreshed thereby, and that he could give none of the particulars of the transaction to which they related. Assuming, all that the plaintiffs claim in this respect, it conferred no authority to obtain an inspection of the books. If the witness has testified falsely the plaintiffs must seek redress through other channels. ( Wayland v. Tysen, 45 N. Y. 281, 285. ) Whether the answers of the witness be true or false is not a matter which can control in the disposition of the question presented by this appeal. That is to be determined solely upon a consideration of the legal rights of the, parties, and as we have seen the plaintiffs were not entitled to examine the witness and thereby obtain an inspection of the books, as such right had already been denied in plain and precise terms » * 327It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with ten dollars costs and disbursements, and the motion to punish for contempt denied.

5462915_1,1649,"By the Court, Davis, P. J. This appeal is taken from a judgment dismissing the complaint, with costs. The papers furnished us omit the judgment roll, and contain nothing but the bill of exceptions and notice of appeal. The bill of exceptions states that at the trial the plaintiff applied and had leave “ to amend his complaint by striking out such matters as might be inconsistent with such amendment, and by inserting instead thereof allegations that the defendant and the National Steam Navigation Company were separate and distinct corporations, and that the defendant accepted the National Steam Navigation Company ’ s property with a distinct agreement to pay the last mentioned company ’ s debts and liabilities. ” The answer of the defendant was then “ so amended as to set up a general denial of these allegations. ” The action, therefore, upon the amended pleadings, must be deemed to be one to enforce in favor of the plaintiff an agreement, alleged to have been made by the defendant to pay the debts and liabilities of another corporation, in consideration of the transfer by such corporation or its liquidators, of all its property to the defendant. The plaintiff gave evidence to show that his assignor, on the 23d day of June, 1868, recovered a judgment in the Superior Court of the city of New York, against the National Steam Navigation Company, for $ 3, 289. 05 damages and costs, on which an execution had been duly issued and returned unsatisfied. * 287The judgment roll showed that the recovery was for an injury to the intestate of the plaintiff ’ s assignor, which caused the death of such intestate, and that such injury was produced by the wrongful act and negligence of the National Steam Navigation Company in the navigation of the ship Pennsylvania, on the ' iHh day of October, • 1867, at which time, it was alleged, the said ship belonged to that company. It showed also that the Navigation Company appeared, and by its answer admitted its own incorporation, and that a collision occurred at the time mentioned between the ship Pennsylvania and the boat on which the intestate was injured ; but put in issue the ownership of the Pennsylvania and all other allegations of the complaint. The plaintiff then gave evidence tending to show that the defendant in this action was incorporated under the laws of Great Britain, & c., on the 1st day of July, 1867, by the name of “ The Steamship Company, limited, ” and that on the 8th day of August, 1867, its name was changed to “ The National Steamship Company, limited. ” That the National Steam Navigation Company, preparatory to a dissolution of that corporation, transferred all its property to two liquidators, under the provisions of the act of parliament known as “ The Companies ’ Act, 1862 ; ” and that said liquidators transferred all of said property to the corporation now sued, on the 16th day of August, 1867, and on that day the Navigation Company ceased to do business, and commenced to wind up its affairs ; that such transfer was made substantially upon the agreement and condition that the National Steamship Company should take and accept such real and personal property, subject to the rights and equities therein subsisting, and in particular to the discharge of the several liabilities appearing on the books, papers and documents of the Navigation Company, and to all other liabilities of the last named company, to which the said real and personal property was then subject ; and would * 288bear, pay and discharge, in due course, the several liabilities disclosed in said books, papers and documents aforesaid, and all other debts, if any, of the said National Steam Navigation Company, and would devote and apply the real and personal property so to be made over to them for that purpose. It is of course apparent that the liability to the plaintiff ’ s assignor for an injury, which occurred to her intestate on the 24th of October, 1867, did not appear in the books, papers and documents of the Steamship Navigation Company on the 16th of August preceding ; nor was it then a debt or liability of that, company which was or could be assumed by the present defendant. In fact the case shows that the action of the plaintiff ’ s assignor was brought against the wrong party. When the injury occurred, the National Steamship Company was the owner of the steamship Pennsylvania, engaged in its navigation, and the alleged wrongful act and negligence were its own, and not those of the corporation which was sued. Neither on sound law nor logic can it be held that by the agreement made on the transfer of the property the defendant bound itself to pay its own liabilities that might thereafter spring out of the wrongful acts and negligence of its own servants ; nor did the agreement contemplate or provide for liabilities of that kind which might be asserted by actions improperly brought against the company, which had ceased to do business, and was existing only in the process of winding up its affairs. The agreement relied upon does not, therefore, embrace the plaintiff ’ s judgment, unless it appears that the injury happened by the act of the Navigation Company, or of its liquidators, in the course of the winding up of its affairs under the act referred to. That does not appear, and probably could not be made to appear consistently with truth, because the Pennsylvania had obviously become the property of another corporation * 289which was using that ship for its own purposes. It is not shown that the present defendant was a privy to the suit against the former company, so that the judgment can either in law or equity be treated as a judgment against itself. It was not prosecuted ; it had, so far as appears, no notice of the suit, and it had no opportunity to appear and defend, and the action was not one in which the present defendant was bound to respond to the defendant in that suit, on the ground that the wrong for which the action was brought was the negligence of the former and not of the latter. A., who is improperly sued for B. ’ s wrongs, cannot compel B. to defend or be liable for the result, by notice that he is sued for an act for which B. alone is liable. Nor can a plaintiff sue a party not liable for an injury, and then subject the actual wrongdoer to liability for the result, by notice of the pendency of such a suit. The privity essential to charge persons not parties to the record, and which makes notice of the suit an estoppel in pais, is altogether lacking in the supposed cases. As the defendant was not bound to defend an action brought against the National Steam Navigation Company for an injury committed by itself, the recovery in the case is no estoppel to any action brought against itself for the same alleged wrong. Nor is the finding of the jury, in that case, that the defendant therein was the owner or navigator of the Pennsylvania an estoppel on that question, against the present defendant. But if this were otherwise, there is a failure of proof, in this case to bring it within the rules governing the liability of privies. It was not error to exclude the statement of the agent, as to the ownership of the Pennsylvania. To make declarations of that character was no part of the duties of his employment by the defendant ; and although his assertion that the National Steam Navigation Company was the owner of the Pennsylvania, doubtless led to the commencement of the suit against the wrong party, yet * 290it does not establish the fact asserted, nor charge the present defendant with the judgment in that case by reason of its falsity. [ First Department, General Term at New York, May 3, 1875. We think the complaint was properly dismissed ; and that the judgment should be affirmed with costs. Judgment affirmed.

The plaintiff gave evidence to show that his assignor, on the 23d day of June, 1868, recovered a judgment in the Superior Court of the city of New York, against the National Steam Navigation Company, for $3,289.05 damages and costs, on which an execution had been duly issued and returned unsatisfied. *287The judgment roll showed that the recovery was for an injury to the intestate of the plaintiff’s assignor, which caused the death of such intestate, and that such injury was produced by the wrongful act and negligence of the National Steam Navigation Company in the navigation of the ship Pennsylvania, on the 'iHh day of October, •1867, at which time, it was alleged, the said ship belonged to that company. It showed also that the Navigation Company appeared, and by its answer admitted its own incorporation, and that a collision occurred at the time mentioned between the ship Pennsylvania and the boat on which the intestate was injured; but put in issue the ownership of the Pennsylvania and all other allegations of the complaint. The plaintiff then gave evidence tending to show that the defendant in this action was incorporated under the laws of Great Britain, &c., on the 1st day of July, 1867, by the name of “ The Steamship Company, limited,” and that on the 8th day of August, 1867, its name was changed to “ The National Steamship Company, limited.” That the National Steam Navigation Company, preparatory to a dissolution of that corporation, transferred all its property to two liquidators, under the provisions of the act of parliament known as “ The Companies’ Act, 1862;” and that said liquidators transferred all of said property to the corporation now sued, on the 16th day of August, 1867, and on that day the Navigation Company ceased to do business, and commenced to wind up its affairs ; that such transfer was made substantially upon the agreement and condition that the National Steamship Company should take and accept such real and personal property, subject to the rights and equities therein subsisting, and in particular to the discharge of the several liabilities appearing on the books, papers and documents of the Navigation Company, and to all other liabilities of the last named company, to which the said real and personal property was then subject; and would *288bear, pay and discharge, in due course, the several liabilities disclosed in said books, papers and documents aforesaid, and all other debts, if any, of the said National Steam Navigation Company, and would devote and apply the real and personal property so to be made over to them for that purpose. It is of course apparent that the liability to the plaintiff’s assignor for an injury, which occurred to her intestate on the 24th of October, 1867, did not appear in the books, papers and documents of the Steamship Navigation Company on the 16th of August preceding; nor was it then a debt or liability of that, company which was or could be assumed by the present defendant. In fact the case shows that the action of the plaintiff’s assignor was brought against the wrong party. When the injury occurred, the National Steamship Company was the owner of the steamship Pennsylvania, engaged in its navigation, and the alleged wrongful act and negligence were its own, and not those of the corporation which was sued. Neither on sound law nor logic can it be held that by the agreement made on the transfer of the property the defendant bound itself to pay its own liabilities that might thereafter spring out of the wrongful acts and negligence of its own servants; nor did the agreement contemplate or provide for liabilities of that kind which might be asserted by actions improperly brought against the company, which had ceased to do business, and was existing only in the process of winding up its affairs. The agreement relied upon does not, therefore, embrace the plaintiff’s judgment, unless it appears that the injury happened by the act of the Navigation Company, or of its liquidators, in the course of the winding up of its affairs under the act referred to. That does not appear, and probably could not be made to appear consistently with truth, because the Pennsylvania had obviously become the property of another corporation *289which was using that ship for its own purposes. It is not shown that the present defendant was a privy to the suit against the former company, so that the judgment can either in law or equity be treated as a judgment against itself. It was not prosecuted; it had, so far as appears, no notice of the suit, and it had no opportunity to appear and defend, and the action was not one in which the present defendant was bound to respond to the defendant in that suit, on the ground that the wrong for which the action was brought was the negligence of the former and not of the latter. A., who is improperly sued for B.’s wrongs, cannot compel B. to defend or be liable for the result, by notice that he is sued for an act for which B. alone is liable. Nor can a plaintiff sue a party not liable for an injury, and then subject the actual wrongdoer to liability for the result, by notice of the pendency of such a suit. The privity essential to charge persons not parties to the record, and which makes notice of the suit an estoppel in pais, is altogether lacking in the supposed cases. As the defendant was not bound to defend an action brought against the National Steam Navigation Company for an injury committed by itself, the recovery in the case is no estoppel to any action brought against itself for the same alleged wrong. Nor is the finding of the jury, in that case, that the defendant therein was the owner or navigator of the Pennsylvania an estoppel on that question, against the present defendant. But if this were otherwise, there is a failure of proof, in this case to bring it within the rules governing the liability of privies. It was not error to exclude the statement of the agent, as to the ownership of the Pennsylvania. To make declarations of that character was no part of the duties of his employment by the defendant; and although his assertion that the National Steam Navigation Company was the owner of the Pennsylvania, doubtless led to the commencement of the suit against the wrong party, yet *290it does not establish the fact asserted, nor charge the present defendant with the judgment in that case by reason of its falsity.

6965076_1,1783,"Mr. Justice Baker delivered the opinion of the Court : This was debt against James M. Smith and his sureties on a bond given in compliance with the requirements of section 5 of the Dram - shop act, and the bond was conditioned for the payment to all persons of all damages that they might sustain, either in person or property or means of support, by reason of said Smith selling or giving aWay any intoxicating liquors. The suit was prosecuted in the name of the People of the State of Illinois, for the use of Anna Williamson. The declaration contained two assignments of breaches. The substance of one was, that said Smith, on divers occasions, sold and gave away intoxicating liquors to William Williamson, the husband of said Anna Williamson, by means whereof said William became, and was habitually intoxicated, and, by reason of so being habitually intoxicated, wasted and squandered his moneys, income and property, and became and was greatly impoverished, reduced, and degraded in mind and body, as well as in his estate, and greatly neglected his duties as a farmer and stock raiser and other business, and thereby said Anna, being his wife, lost and was deprived of her means of support. And the substance of the other was, that on the 12th day of August, 1889, said William Williamson, being in a state of intoxication caused by said Smith selling and giving to him intoxicating liquors, was incapacitated, by reason of such intoxication, from properly and safely managing, driving and controlling a team of horses drawing a wagon in which he was riding, by. means whereof said team ran away and said William Williamson was thrown out of the wagon and killed, and that thereby said Anna Williamson was injured in and deprived of her means of support. Upon the issues formed in the case there was a jury trial, and a verdict and judgment for the penalty of the bond and for $ 1000 damages, and the judgment was afterwards affirmed in the Appellate Court. Complaint is made by Smith and the other appellants of some four or five of the instructions which were given on the motion of the plaintiff below, on these grounds : that by them the court submitted to the jury the question of the giving of intoxicating liquors as well as the question of the - selling of such liquors, and also submitted the question whether or hot the beer which William Williamson drank at the saloon of Smith during the afternoon and night of the 12th of August, 1889, was an intoxicating liquor. In. respect to the first objection, suffice it to say that the declaration alleged as well the giving as the selling of intoxicating liquors, and that there was some evidence, though but slight, tending to prove the giving of such liquors. The second objection is likewise untenable. It may be that no witness testified, in positive terms, that the beer that Williamson drank on the 12th day of August was an intoxicating liquor ; but that fact, like most, other facts, may be established by other than direct and positive proof, and here the proof was ample that Williamson drank beer very many times during the afternoon, and until about nine o ’ clock at night, in the saloon of Smith, and became intoxicated, and left there with a bottle of whisky in his pocket. If the direct result of drinking Smith ’ s beer was intoxication, it may reasonably be presumed that Smith ’ s beer was an intoxicating liquor. Instruction No. 5 did not assume that beer is an intoxicating liquor, but left it to the jury to determine, from the evidence, whether the death of Mrs. Williamson ’ s husband “ was occasioned by intoxication produced by beer which was intoxicating, or other intoxicating liquors sold or given to him. by the defendant. ” We have difficulty in comprehending the point of the criticism made by appellants on the clause found in instruction No. 6, which reads as follows : “ caused from intoxication in whole or in part produced by the sale of intoxicating liquors sold to him by the defendant James M. Smith. ” Very plainly this means, “ in whole or in part produced by the sale of intoxicating liquors sold to him by the defendant James M. Smith, ” and does not mean either “ intoxication in whole or in part, ” or “ caused from intoxication in whole or in part. ” We do not see how it could reasonably be understood by the jury otherwise than we have suggested ; but even if there was intoxication “ in part, ” or partial intoxication, yet if such intoxication was sufficient to have “ caused ” the death of the deceased, we are unable to see why the case is not within the purview of the statute. So, also, if, notwithstanding the intoxication of the deceased, he would not - have been killed if his horses had not run away, yet nevertheless there would be a good cause of action. The very gravamen of the case is, that he, in consequence of his intoxication, was unable to properly manage and control his team, and that in consequence thereof they ran away, and he was thrown out of the ’ wagon and killed. It is assigned as error that the court refused to give certain of the instructions asked by appellants. It was not error to refuse to tell the jury that, as a matter of law, the word “ intoxication, ” used in the Dram - shop act, means “ excited to frenzy. ” The denial of the instruction that no. recovery could be had in the case if the death of the deceased was occasioned by the negligence or want of caution or willful act of the deceased in handling or driving a dangerous team, was clearly not error. The instruction does not exclude the hypothesis that such negligence, want of caution or willful act was due to or caused by his intoxication. Instruction No. 3 was properly refused, and for like reason. Even if the clips or fastenings on the whiffletrees dropped off and allowed the tongue of the wagon to drop down upon the road, and in consequence the team became frightened and unmanageable, and ran away, yet, non constat, that if the deceased had been duly sober and in fit condition to manage and control the team he would not have been able to prevent the running away of the horses or the overturning of the wagon. The court refused to instruct the jury that they had “ no right to consider any evidence in relation to William Williamson having been drunk on former occasions not connected with the time of his death, or any habit the deceased may have had of using intoxicating liquors prior to the day of his death. ” It also, over the objections of appellants, admitted evidence of the habit of the deceased, prior to the day of his death, in relation to drinking liquors and becoming intoxicated. These rulings of the court are questioned by the assignments of error. It must be borne in mind that there are two assignments of breach in the declaration, and that the first of them is, that appellant Smith, in the lifetime of William Williamson, sold and gave said Williamson intoxicating liquors, he, said Williamson, then being an habitual drunkard, and that thereby his wife, the appellee, was injured in respect to her means of support. The challenged evidence was admissible under this first breach, and the giving of the proffered instruction would have been understood by the jury as excluding from their consideration all claim for damages based on said breach. There was no error in said rulings. The evidence was not admissible, however, for the purpose of forming a basis for the allowance of punitive damages. In Cobb v. The People, 84 Ill. 511, this court held, that in a suit on a bond executed under section 5 of the Dram - shop act exemplary damages can not be recovered, but only such actual damages as the party for whose use the suit is brought may sustain, either in person, property or means of support.

To this answer the plaintiff and respondent interposed a general demurrer on the ground that it did not contain facts sufficient to constitute a defense. The court sustained the demurrer and rendered judgment on the complaint. The appellant excepted to the ruling of the court below, and appeals from the judgment so rendered.

That the agreement alleged in the answer was a promise by Bowman to answer for the debt of the Idaho World Printing Company to Ainslie, which, not being alleged to have been made in writing, appears, from the face of the answer, to be void under the statute of frauds ; and 2. That the agreement alleged is not valid between Bowman and the maker of the note, and not binding upon Bowman, because the Idaho World Printing Company, whose funds were to be disposed of under the agreement, did not authorize, sanction, or consent to such disposition. The first position assumed by the respondent is not tenable, for even if the answer could be regarded as alleging a promise on the part of Bowman to pay the debt of the Idaho World Printing Company to Ainslie, it is not alleged, nor does it appear upon the face of the answer, that such contract or agreement was verbal ; and it is the well - settled law, that the statute of frauds does not change the rules of pleading. Unless the agreement appears, from the com * 646plaint or pleading, to bave been yerbal, the court will presume that it was in writing, when the nature of the agreement is such that it could not be valid unless in writing ; but when the party alleging the agreement comes to the proof of his allegations, he must show such an agreement as is valid under the statute of frauds. But the answer, as we construe it, sets up an agreement made contemporaneously with the giving of the note sued on, whereby Bowman undertook to collect money upon the bills and accounts of the Idaho World Printing Company, then in his hands, and apply the same, when collected, in satisfaction of the note, at the same time agreeing between themselves that Ainslie was a creditor of said printing company. And the real question to be determined is, whether such an agreement is valid. Is it such an agreement as could have been introduced in evidence, provided the plea of payment had been directly interposed instead of attempting to set up probative facts, from which the ultimate fact of payment is to be inferred? It was not lawful for Bowman to agree that there was money due from the printing company to Ainslie, unless he had authority, and none is alleged ; and it ivas not proper for him to pay the money of the company to Ainslie, even though he was a creditor of the company, unless the consent or authority of the company had first been obtained, and no such consent or authority is alleged. If Bowman collected money for that company, as alleged in the answer, unless he had its authority to make some other disposition of it, he became liable to pay it to the company, and no agreement made by him, without the authority of the company, to pay it to any other person, even a creditor of the company, could relieve him from that liability. It follows that the agreement between Bowman and Ainslie, stated in the answer, is invalid, and can not be enforced.

5530509_1,4815,"Jasen, J. The principal issue presented for our consideration is whether, in a prosecution for homicide, 1 a defendant, in support of his contention that he had reasonable grounds to believe himself in imminent danger from an assault by the deceased, may offer evidence to show that, prior to the homicide, the deceased committed specific acts of violence of which the defendant had knowledge. Defendant Willie Miller was charged with fatally shooting his sister Minnie in the course of a violent family quarrel. After work on October 12, 1972, the members of the Miller family returned home from their various places of employment. Among the persons present in the home were the defendant, then 20 years old, the deceased, 22 years old, their mother, Mrs. Mae Miller, their sister and the deceased ’ s boyfriend, a man named Eddie Brooks. Brooks came prepared with a quantity of Seconal capsules which he distributed to the members of the family. Both Willie and Minnie ingested at least two pills apiece. Brooks also had marijuana, which was proffered to a number of persons, again including the defendant and the deceased. After Brooks left the house, Willie and Minnie went out to cash her paycheck, using some of the cash thus obtained to purchase liquor. During the course of the next few hours, the family and friends played some records, danced and drank quantities of "" screwdrivers ”, wine and beer. At some point in the evening, Minnie announced that she was drunk and retired upstairs to take a nap. Sometime after midnight, Minnie awakened and discovered that the remaining money from her cashed paycheck was missing. She became extremely distraught and accused her mother of stealing the money. After Minnie had left the party, * 547Mae Miller had gone out to visit a nearby friend. Willie brought her back to the house so that she might deny the accusation. As soon as Mae Miller returned home, Minnie stridently repeated her allegations and endeavored to strike her mother. Willie grabbed her arm and forced her down to her side. The mother started to cry and frightened, she sat down out of harm ’ s way. Minnie, however, directed her attentions at her brother. She began to punch, kick and grab him, cursing and swearing at him all the while. Willie, on the other hand, was simply trying to calm his sister down. When others attempted to subdue Minnie, she pushed them out of the way. Minnie ripped out the wires from a television set she had purchased for her mother. At one point, Willie attempted to hold Minnie down in a chair but could not restrain her for very long. Still incensed, Minnie went into the kitchen, followed by Willie. Minnie warned him off, telling him "" Get out of here before I kill you ”. She reached into a drawer and removed a large barbecue fork. When this was wrestled away from her without damage, she went back to the drawer and pulled out a butcher knife. She slashed at one side of Willie ’ s face, knocking off his glasses and cutting his chin. Willie fled from the kitchen and ran upstairs. Minnie returned to the living room where she stood for a time in the corner "" slobbering ” at the mouth. According to Willie ’ s testimony at the trial, Minnie returned upstairs, remarked that she should have cut his throat when they were downstairs, and told him that she was going to kill him. When she continued to advance, Willie backed up into his room and lifted his shotgun from a corner of his closet. When Willie emerged from his room, Minnie was still outside, holding the knife in her upraised hand. As she started walking towards him, he fired the shotgun, inflicting a fatal abdominal wound. After the shooting, defendant co - operated fully with the police. He voluntarily gave them a sworn statement which shed great doubt on his claim of self - defense. In the statement Willie stated that his shotgun was stored in a closet, that he loaded it and took care to be certain that the safety was off. "" My mother had come into the room, and tried to get the gun away from me. I pushed her away, walked into the hallway, where my sister was still screaming about what she was going to do to me ; I looked to my sister who was then standing about eight to ten feet away from my room, and pointed the * 548gun at her from my hip, and discharged same toward her. ” He also stated that he did not actually see a knife in her hand, although it was his opinion that she still had the knife. Even more damaging was his statement that, after being cut, he told his sister, "" OK, I ’ m going to get you. ” At the trial, to substantiate the defense claim of justification, counsel attempted to elicit from various witnesses the details of specific instances of violent behavior on the part of the deceased of which the entire family, including defendant, was aware. The defense offered to prove that Minnie would become extremely violent when under the influence of alcohol or drugs, that she had been confined in a mental institution, that she had once fought with her mother and bit her mother ’ s finger so severely that the nail had to be removed, that she had pushed her mother down a flight of stairs, that Minnie had, on occasion, thrown objects at her mother, and had once, for no apparent reason, jumped through a glass window. The trial court, citing People v Rodawald ( 177 NY 408 ), refused to permit the defendant to introduce evidence of specific violent acts of the deceased. In response to defense counsel ’ s argument that as a matter of commonsense proof of specific acts should be admissible because of its probative value, the court stated that "" [ ujnfortunately the law of the State of New York hasn ’ t gone into that. ” The jury found the defendant guilty of murder. The Appellate Division, with one Justice dissenting, affirmed the conviction, noting that, in its view, "" the trial court properly refused to allow questions framed by the defense counsel which were directed to specific acts of violence ”. ( People v Miller ; 46 AD2d 108, 109. ) A defendant in a homicide or assault prosecution may assert, as a defense, that his use of physical force upon the alleged victim was not unlawful since it was necessary to protect himself or others from the victim ’ s aggression. ( See Penal Law, § 35. 15. ) The defense is only available where the belief of the defendant that he was subject to an imminent attack is a reasonable one. Thus, the perceptions, the state of mind, of the participants to the encounter are critical to a ^ plaim of justification. It has long been the rule in this State that a defendant, in a prosecution for homicide, may introduce evidence that the deceased had a reputation as a "" quarrelsome, vindicative or violent ” person, provided that the defendant was aware of this * 549reputation at the time of the incident. ( People v Rodawald, 177 NY 408, 423, supra ; People v Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 95 ; People v Flournoy, 14 AD2d 854. ) "" The character of the deceased with reference to violence, when known to the accused, enables him to judge of the danger and aids the jury in deciding whether he acted in good faith and upon the honest belief that his life was in peril. It shows the state of his mind as to the necessity of defending himself. ” ( People v Rodawald, supra, p 423 ; see, generally, Evidence — Self - Defense — Reputation, Ann., 1 ALR3d 571. ) Similarly, the threats of the deceased against the defendant are admissible, whether communicated to the defendant or not. Even if the defendant was not aware of the threat, the threat still is probative of the deceased ’ s state of mind and bears, thus, on whether the deceased was the aggressor. ( Stokes v People, 53 NY 164, 174. ) On the other hand, if the defendant did hear of the threat, the threat may also serve to indicate the defendant ’ s own apprehensive state of mind. ( People v Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 95, supra ; Richardson, Evidence [ 10 ed ], § 157. ) The courts of our State have consistently held that while the deceased ’ s general reputation for violence is provable, evidence of specific acts of violence by the deceased is inadmissible. ( Eggler v People, 56 NY 642 ; Thomas v People, 67 NY 218, 223 ; People v Druse, 103 NY 655 ; People v Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 95, supra. ) "" [ T ] his is improper ”, we said in People v Rodawald ( supra ), "" not only because character is never established by proof of individual acts, but because each specific act shown would create a new issue. ” ( 177 NY 408, 424 ; see 40 CJS, Homicide, § 222, subd a, par [ 2 ], pp 1141 - 1142. ) Today we are called upon to reconsider this aspect of the rule. The rule we have followed in New York is the traditional rule and, for many years, was the general rule. ( See Self - Defense — Evidence — Admissibility, Ann., 121 ALR 380, 382. ) However, the trend of the decisions in other jurisdictions, even in certain jurisdictions which formerly denied the admissibility of testimony as to specific acts, is towards the admissibility of such evidence. 2 * 550The States that authorize the admission of prior violent acts of the deceased, known to the defendant, stress the relevance of such evidence on the issue of whether the defendant ’ s asserted fear of the deceased was reasonable. ( See McMorris v State, 58 Wis 2d 144 ; State v Gordon, 37 Del 219, 222. ) Noted commentators have taken similar positions. ( See 1 Wigmore, Evidence [ 3d ed ], § 198, pp 676 - 677 ; Richardson, Evidence [ 10th ed ], § 157, p 128 ; see, also, Comment, 1974 Wis L Rev 266. ) A few jurisdictions have gone so far as to permit the defendant to introduce into evidence the criminal record of the deceased. ( See Commonwealth v Amos, 445 Pa 297 ; cf. Ruffin v State, 50 Del 83. ) On the other hand, the States that continue to adhere to the traditional rule of exclusion place emphasis upon the theory that a reputation for violence cannot be proved by evidence of specific acts. ( See State v Maggitt, 517 SW2d 105 [ Mo ] ; Johnson v Commonwealth, 477 SW2d 159 [ Ky ]. ) While it has long been recognized that circumstantial evidence of the victim ’ s character and reputation is relevant to show the state of the defendant ’ s mind as to the necessity of defending himself, such evidence was not always admissible. ( Cf. Richardson, Evidence [ 10th ed ], § § 145, 149, 157. ) Reasons of policy have led the courts to impose restrictions upon the method by which this relevant evidence may be proved and to regulate, carefully, the extent to which such evidence may be received in particular cases. The most fundamental policy consideration is that every person, regardless of his relative worth to the community, has the right to live undisturbed by unlawful assault. Since "" the worst man has the right to live the same as the best, no one may attack another because his general reputation is bad. ” ( People v Rodawald, 177 NY 408, 422 - 423, supra. ) Thus, evi * 551dence that the deceased generally had a poor reputation in the community is not admissible lest a jury find a homicide justifiable for the wrong reason — i. e., that the deceased was unworthy of life. This fear has also militated against the admission of proof that the deceased committed specific vicious, immoral or illegal acts in the past. A second consideration is the need to carefully limit and narrow the issues that the jury must decide. In our adversary system, it is important to rivet the jury ’ s attention on the real issues at trial without undue diversion to collateral matters having little or no bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defendant. ( Cf. People v Van Gaasbeck, 189 NY 408, 418. ) These considerations are, of course, not without counterbalancing factors. The paramount purpose of all rules of evidence is to ensure that the jury will hear all pertinent, reliable and probative evidence which bears on the disputed issues. The considerations heretofore discussed do not mandate the total exclusion of character evidence ; rather, they explain the need for careful and reasonable rules by which relevant facts may be adduced in an orderly manner, without causing needless confusion and obfuscation. Upon due reflection, we believe that the present New York rule should be modified to permit a defendant in a criminal case, where justification is an issue, to introduce evidence of the victim ’ s prior specific acts of violence of which the defendant had knowledge, provided that the acts sought to be established are reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant stands charged. Generally, character and reputation may not be proved by reference to specific acts, except to impeach the credibility of character witnesses. However, the crucial fact at issue, where a claim of justification is presented, is not the character of the victim, but, rather, the state of mind of the defendant. Knowl - | edge of prior violent acts of the victim may weigh heavily upon the mind of a defendant when, as asserted, he moved to blunt the aggression of the victim. Indeed, knowledge of specific instances of violence by the victim may have a more significant impact on a defendant ’ s mental state than any vague awareness of a general reputation for violence. A demonstrated capacity for acts of extreme violence will no doubt instill a fear more quickly and more deeply than a veiled threat or knowledge of a generally violent proclivity. For this reason, we believe that a defendant, asserting at trial * 552justification as a defense, ought to be permitted to adduce evidence of violent acts of the victim and his knowledge thereof. At the same time, however, the jury must be cautioned that this evidence may only be considered with respect to the issue of the reasonableness of defendant ’ s apprehensions, and, further, that the character of the deceased and his specific past violent acts are not otherwise relevant to the issues before them. We can discern no valid distinction as to admissibility between violent acts that the victim directed at the defendant and acts which the victim directed towards identified third persons. The crucial factor is not who was the target of the violence, but that the defendant was aware at the time of the incident of the victim ’ s past violent behavior. On the other hand, not all acts of violence committed by the victim in the past are necessarily relevant to the issues presented by a claim of justification. There may be instances where acts are too remote in time or of a greatly different quality than the one which the defendant accuses the victim of committing. In such cases, the trial court may, upon consideration of an offer of proof, decline, in the exercise of its sound discretion, to admit the proof into evidence. ( McMorris v State, 58 Wis 2d 144, supra ; 1 Wigmore, Evidence [ 3d ed ], § 198. ) However, that some acts should properly be excluded does not justify a general rule of exclusion. The appropriate test is whether the acts sought to be proved relate reasonably, in time and quality, to the defense raised by the defendant. The extent to which prior violent acts may be proved rests also in the discretion of the trial court. We are ever mindful of the danger that the principal issues to be resolved may be lost in an endless maze of collateral matters. Moreover, we share the concern that the progress of a criminal trial may become stalled by evidentiary conflicts over matters of tangential relevance, thereby impeding the expeditious administration of justice. Yet, a basic sense of fairness mandates that the defendant be permitted to substantiate his claim that the victim committed specific violent acts in the past because it enlightens the jury on the state of the defendant ’ s mind at the time of the difficulty, and thereby enables them to decide whether he acted rationally under the circumstances. By the same token, the prosecution should be given a fair opportunity to dispute the defendant ’ s contention through presentation of its evidence, as well as by vigorous cross - examination of the * 553defendant and his witnesses. The trial court, having the opportunity to view the witnesses as they testify, may place limitations on the extent that such matters may be proved or disproved in a particular case. We have previously noted that some States permit the defendant to introduce into evidence the criminal record of the victim. Evidence of a conviction for a violent act is, of course, acceptable documentary evidence that would support the defendant ’ s contention, provided he was aware of the conviction at the time of the incident. However, the defendant is not thereby authorized to introduce, without limitations, an entire criminal record which may include convictions for petty matters or for crimes that in no sense could be considered violent. Admission of an entire criminal record is, truly, an effort to disparage the victim ’ s general character and is not probative of the defendant ’ s apprehensive state of mind. We, therefore, are careful to note that while specific convictions for violent acts may be admissible, provided the defendant had knowledge of same, general proof of the victim ’ s criminal disposition is not. "" The decision in each case as to similar nature and remoteness, however, rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge. ” ( Commonwealth v Amos, 445 Pa 297, 305, supra. ) In sum, then, we believe that our present rule precluding the admission of prior violent acts of victims in cases where a claim of justification is made should be changed to allow such evidence where it is shown that the defendant was actually aware of such particular acts at the time of the homicide or assault. Applying the new rule to the case before us, we conclude that a new trial is necessary. There is evidence in the record that the defendant killed his sister in the aftermath of a family dispute stimulated by the sister ’ s extreme aggravation over an asserted theft of money. The principal question of fact before the jury was whether the defendant shot his sister in self - defense, believing to be in imminent danger of an assault by the sister, or whether he shot her deliberately, without justification, after the family dispute had been broken off. Under these circumstances, the jury should be permitted to consider proof that the defendant was aware of his sister ’ s prior violent attacks upon her mother who, after all, was asserted by the sister to be the thief, and was, thus, the source of her anger. Since this evidence, if believed by the jury, would be probative on the reasonableness of defendant ’ s * 554apprehension for his own safety, we are compelled to conclude that there is a significant probability that the jury might have credited the defense of justification had it been apprised of the victim ’ s prior acts of violence. ( People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230, 242. ) We do not, however, imply that at a new trial the court must admit into evidence all the instances which the defense sought to establish at the first trial. We hold simply that, under the newly announced rule, evidence of specific acts of violence committed by deceased should not be excluded if the evidence is relevant and probative to show the state of the defendant ’ s mind as to the necessity of defending himself. As previously noted, the trial court also has discretion in the extent and in a manner in which the incidents are sought to be proved. We have examined the other points advanced by the defendant and find that, in no respect, did the courts below fall into error. We reverse not because the courts below failed to properly administer the law, but because we believe the law itself should be changed, and that the defendant is entitled to the benefit of that change. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered. Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Cooke concur. Order reversed, etc. . Similar considerations, of course, obtain in prosecutions for assault. For convenience, we need only make reference to that type of case as is presently before us, homicide. . An examination of the more recent cases in other American jurisdictions is instructive. California, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin, North Carolina and one Federal court permit the introduction of evidence establishing specific violent acts of the victim, provided that the defendant knew of them. ( See Cal Evidence Code, § 1103, subd [ 1 ] ; People v Rowland, 262 Cal App 2d 790, 797 ; Commonwealth v Amos, 445 Pa 297 ; Ruffin v State, 50 Del 83 [ where defendant was * 550allowed to prove some specific acts, not error to preclude further inquiry into deceased ’ s criminal record ] ; Stover v Commonwealth, 211 Va 789, cert den 412 US 953 ; Wood v State, 486 SW2d 359 [ Tex ] ; McMorris v State, 58 Wis 2d 144 ; State v Johnson, 270 NC 215 ; United States v Burks, 470 F2d 432 ; see, also, Mortimore v State, 24 Wyo 452 ; Mendez v State, 27 Ariz 82. ) Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa and Louisiana have adhered to the rule of exclusion. ( See Williamson v State, 25 Md App 338 ; State v Maggitt, 517 SW2d 105 ; Johnson v Commonwealth, 477 SW2d 159 [ Ky ] ; State v Kimbrough, 173 Neb 873 ; State v Keaton, 258 Minn 359 ; State v Rhone, 223 Iowa 1221 ; People v Singleton, 311 So 2d 881 [ La ]. ) Several jurisdictions have adopted a middle ground, permitting the introduction of evidence relating to specific violent acts directed at the defendant, but excluding evidence of acts directed at third persons. ( See People v Davis, 29 Ill 2d 127 ; People v Farrell, 137 Mich 127 ; Henley v State, 520 SW2d 361 [ Tenn ] ; Chaffin v State, 209 Tenn 590. )",5530509," Jasen, J. The principal issue presented for our consideration is whether, in a prosecution for homicide,1 a defendant, in support of his contention that he had reasonable grounds to believe himself in imminent danger from an assault by the deceased, may offer evidence to show that, prior to the homicide, the deceased committed specific acts of violence of which the defendant had knowledge. Defendant Willie Miller was charged with fatally shooting his sister Minnie in the course of a violent family quarrel. After work on October 12, 1972, the members of the Miller family returned home from their various places of employment. Among the persons present in the home were the defendant, then 20 years old, the deceased, 22 years old, their mother, Mrs. Mae Miller, their sister and the deceased’s boyfriend, a man named Eddie Brooks. Brooks came prepared with a quantity of Seconal capsules which he distributed to the members of the family. Both Willie and Minnie ingested at least two pills apiece. Brooks also had marijuana, which was proffered to a number of persons, again including the defendant and the deceased. After Brooks left the house, Willie and Minnie went out to cash her paycheck, using some of the cash thus obtained to purchase liquor. During the course of the next few hours, the family and friends played some records, danced and drank quantities of ""screwdrivers”, wine and beer. At some point in the evening, Minnie announced that she was drunk and retired upstairs to take a nap. Sometime after midnight, Minnie awakened and discovered that the remaining money from her cashed paycheck was missing. She became extremely distraught and accused her mother of stealing the money. After Minnie had left the party, *547Mae Miller had gone out to visit a nearby friend. Willie brought her back to the house so that she might deny the accusation. As soon as Mae Miller returned home, Minnie stridently repeated her allegations and endeavored to strike her mother. Willie grabbed her arm and forced her down to her side. The mother started to cry and frightened, she sat down out of harm’s way. Minnie, however, directed her attentions at her brother. She began to punch, kick and grab him, cursing and swearing at him all the while. Willie, on the other hand, was simply trying to calm his sister down. When others attempted to subdue Minnie, she pushed them out of the way. Minnie ripped out the wires from a television set she had purchased for her mother. At one point, Willie attempted to hold Minnie down in a chair but could not restrain her for very long. Still incensed, Minnie went into the kitchen, followed by Willie. Minnie warned him off, telling him ""Get out of here before I kill you”. She reached into a drawer and removed a large barbecue fork. When this was wrestled away from her without damage, she went back to the drawer and pulled out a butcher knife. She slashed at one side of Willie’s face, knocking off his glasses and cutting his chin. Willie fled from the kitchen and ran upstairs. Minnie returned to the living room where she stood for a time in the corner ""slobbering” at the mouth. According to Willie’s testimony at the trial, Minnie returned upstairs, remarked that she should have cut his throat when they were downstairs, and told him that she was going to kill him. When she continued to advance, Willie backed up into his room and lifted his shotgun from a corner of his closet. When Willie emerged from his room, Minnie was still outside, holding the knife in her upraised hand. As she started walking towards him, he fired the shotgun, inflicting a fatal abdominal wound. After the shooting, defendant co-operated fully with the police. He voluntarily gave them a sworn statement which shed great doubt on his claim of self-defense. In the statement Willie stated that his shotgun was stored in a closet, that he loaded it and took care to be certain that the safety was off. ""My mother had come into the room, and tried to get the gun away from me. I pushed her away, walked into the hallway, where my sister was still screaming about what she was going to do to me; I looked to my sister who was then standing about eight to ten feet away from my room, and pointed the *548gun at her from my hip, and discharged same toward her.” He also stated that he did not actually see a knife in her hand, although it was his opinion that she still had the knife. Even more damaging was his statement that, after being cut, he told his sister, ""OK, I’m going to get you.” At the trial, to substantiate the defense claim of justification, counsel attempted to elicit from various witnesses the details of specific instances of violent behavior on the part of the deceased of which the entire family, including defendant, was aware. The defense offered to prove that Minnie would become extremely violent when under the influence of alcohol or drugs, that she had been confined in a mental institution, that she had once fought with her mother and bit her mother’s finger so severely that the nail had to be removed, that she had pushed her mother down a flight of stairs, that Minnie had, on occasion, thrown objects at her mother, and had once, for no apparent reason, jumped through a glass window. The trial court, citing People v Rodawald (177 NY 408), refused to permit the defendant to introduce evidence of specific violent acts of the deceased. In response to defense counsel’s argument that as a matter of commonsense proof of specific acts should be admissible because of its probative value, the court stated that ""[ujnfortunately the law of the State of New York hasn’t gone into that.” The jury found the defendant guilty of murder. The Appellate Division, with one Justice dissenting, affirmed the conviction, noting that, in its view, ""the trial court properly refused to allow questions framed by the defense counsel which were directed to specific acts of violence”. (People v Miller; 46 AD2d 108, 109.) A defendant in a homicide or assault prosecution may assert, as a defense, that his use of physical force upon the alleged victim was not unlawful since it was necessary to protect himself or others from the victim’s aggression. (See Penal Law, § 35.15.) The defense is only available where the belief of the defendant that he was subject to an imminent attack is a reasonable one. Thus, the perceptions, the state of mind, of the participants to the encounter are critical to a ^plaim of justification. It has long been the rule in this State that a defendant, in a prosecution for homicide, may introduce evidence that the deceased had a reputation as a ""quarrelsome, vindicative or violent” person, provided that the defendant was aware of this *549reputation at the time of the incident. (People v Rodawald, 177 NY 408, 423, supra; People v Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 95; People v Flournoy, 14 AD2d 854.) ""The character of the deceased with reference to violence, when known to the accused, enables him to judge of the danger and aids the jury in deciding whether he acted in good faith and upon the honest belief that his life was in peril. It shows the state of his mind as to the necessity of defending himself.” (People v Rodawald, supra, p 423; see, generally, Evidence—Self-Defense—Reputation, Ann., 1 ALR3d 571.) Similarly, the threats of the deceased against the defendant are admissible, whether communicated to the defendant or not. Even if the defendant was not aware of the threat, the threat still is probative of the deceased’s state of mind and bears, thus, on whether the deceased was the aggressor. (Stokes v People, 53 NY 164, 174.) On the other hand, if the defendant did hear of the threat, the threat may also serve to indicate the defendant’s own apprehensive state of mind. (People v Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 95, supra; Richardson, Evidence [10 ed], § 157.) The courts of our State have consistently held that while the deceased’s general reputation for violence is provable, evidence of specific acts of violence by the deceased is inadmissible. (Eggler v People, 56 NY 642; Thomas v People, 67 NY 218, 223; People v Druse, 103 NY 655; People v Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 95, supra.) ""[T]his is improper”, we said in People v Rodawald (supra), ""not only because character is never established by proof of individual acts, but because each specific act shown would create a new issue.” (177 NY 408, 424; see 40 CJS, Homicide, § 222, subd a, par [2], pp 1141-1142.) Today we are called upon to reconsider this aspect of the rule. The rule we have followed in New York is the traditional rule and, for many years, was the general rule. (See Self-Defense—Evidence—Admissibility, Ann., 121 ALR 380, 382.) However, the trend of the decisions in other jurisdictions, even in certain jurisdictions which formerly denied the admissibility of testimony as to specific acts, is towards the admissibility of such evidence.2 *550The States that authorize the admission of prior violent acts of the deceased, known to the defendant, stress the relevance of such evidence on the issue of whether the defendant’s asserted fear of the deceased was reasonable. (See McMorris v State, 58 Wis 2d 144; State v Gordon, 37 Del 219, 222.) Noted commentators have taken similar positions. (See 1 Wigmore, Evidence [3d ed], § 198, pp 676-677; Richardson, Evidence [10th ed], § 157, p 128; see, also, Comment, 1974 Wis L Rev 266.) A few jurisdictions have gone so far as to permit the defendant to introduce into evidence the criminal record of the deceased. (See Commonwealth v Amos, 445 Pa 297; cf. Ruffin v State, 50 Del 83.) On the other hand, the States that continue to adhere to the traditional rule of exclusion place emphasis upon the theory that a reputation for violence cannot be proved by evidence of specific acts. (See State v Maggitt, 517 SW2d 105 [Mo]; Johnson v Commonwealth, 477 SW2d 159 [Ky].) While it has long been recognized that circumstantial evidence of the victim’s character and reputation is relevant to show the state of the defendant’s mind as to the necessity of defending himself, such evidence was not always admissible. (Cf. Richardson, Evidence [10th ed], §§ 145, 149, 157.) Reasons of policy have led the courts to impose restrictions upon the method by which this relevant evidence may be proved and to regulate, carefully, the extent to which such evidence may be received in particular cases. The most fundamental policy consideration is that every person, regardless of his relative worth to the community, has the right to live undisturbed by unlawful assault. Since ""the worst man has the right to live the same as the best, no one may attack another because his general reputation is bad.” (People v Rodawald, 177 NY 408, 422-423, supra.) Thus, evi*551dence that the deceased generally had a poor reputation in the community is not admissible lest a jury find a homicide justifiable for the wrong reason—i.e., that the deceased was unworthy of life. This fear has also militated against the admission of proof that the deceased committed specific vicious, immoral or illegal acts in the past. A second consideration is the need to carefully limit and narrow the issues that the jury must decide. In our adversary system, it is important to rivet the jury’s attention on the real issues at trial without undue diversion to collateral matters having little or no bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defendant. (Cf. People v Van Gaasbeck, 189 NY 408, 418.) These considerations are, of course, not without counterbalancing factors. The paramount purpose of all rules of evidence is to ensure that the jury will hear all pertinent, reliable and probative evidence which bears on the disputed issues. The considerations heretofore discussed do not mandate the total exclusion of character evidence; rather, they explain the need for careful and reasonable rules by which relevant facts may be adduced in an orderly manner, without causing needless confusion and obfuscation. Upon due reflection, we believe that the present New York rule should be modified to permit a defendant in a criminal case, where justification is an issue, to introduce evidence of the victim’s prior specific acts of violence of which the defendant had knowledge, provided that the acts sought to be established are reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant stands charged. Generally, character and reputation may not be proved by reference to specific acts, except to impeach the credibility of character witnesses. However, the crucial fact at issue, where a claim of justification is presented, is not the character of the victim, but, rather, the state of mind of the defendant. Knowl- | edge of prior violent acts of the victim may weigh heavily upon the mind of a defendant when, as asserted, he moved to blunt the aggression of the victim. Indeed, knowledge of specific instances of violence by the victim may have a more significant impact on a defendant’s mental state than any vague awareness of a general reputation for violence. A demonstrated capacity for acts of extreme violence will no doubt instill a fear more quickly and more deeply than a veiled threat or knowledge of a generally violent proclivity. For this reason, we believe that a defendant, asserting at trial *552justification as a defense, ought to be permitted to adduce evidence of violent acts of the victim and his knowledge thereof. At the same time, however, the jury must be cautioned that this evidence may only be considered with respect to the issue of the reasonableness of defendant’s apprehensions, and, further, that the character of the deceased and his specific past violent acts are not otherwise relevant to the issues before them. We can discern no valid distinction as to admissibility between violent acts that the victim directed at the defendant and acts which the victim directed towards identified third persons. The crucial factor is not who was the target of the violence, but that the defendant was aware at the time of the incident of the victim’s past violent behavior. On the other hand, not all acts of violence committed by the victim in the past are necessarily relevant to the issues presented by a claim of justification. There may be instances where acts are too remote in time or of a greatly different quality than the one which the defendant accuses the victim of committing. In such cases, the trial court may, upon consideration of an offer of proof, decline, in the exercise of its sound discretion, to admit the proof into evidence. (McMorris v State, 58 Wis 2d 144, supra; 1 Wigmore, Evidence [3d ed], § 198.) However, that some acts should properly be excluded does not justify a general rule of exclusion. The appropriate test is whether the acts sought to be proved relate reasonably, in time and quality, to the defense raised by the defendant. The extent to which prior violent acts may be proved rests also in the discretion of the trial court. We are ever mindful of the danger that the principal issues to be resolved may be lost in an endless maze of collateral matters. Moreover, we share the concern that the progress of a criminal trial may become stalled by evidentiary conflicts over matters of tangential relevance, thereby impeding the expeditious administration of justice. Yet, a basic sense of fairness mandates that the defendant be permitted to substantiate his claim that the victim committed specific violent acts in the past because it enlightens the jury on the state of the defendant’s mind at the time of the difficulty, and thereby enables them to decide whether he acted rationally under the circumstances. By the same token, the prosecution should be given a fair opportunity to dispute the defendant’s contention through presentation of its evidence, as well as by vigorous cross-examination of the *553defendant and his witnesses. The trial court, having the opportunity to view the witnesses as they testify, may place limitations on the extent that such matters may be proved or disproved in a particular case. We have previously noted that some States permit the defendant to introduce into evidence the criminal record of the victim. Evidence of a conviction for a violent act is, of course, acceptable documentary evidence that would support the defendant’s contention, provided he was aware of the conviction at the time of the incident. However, the defendant is not thereby authorized to introduce, without limitations, an entire criminal record which may include convictions for petty matters or for crimes that in no sense could be considered violent. Admission of an entire criminal record is, truly, an effort to disparage the victim’s general character and is not probative of the defendant’s apprehensive state of mind. We, therefore, are careful to note that while specific convictions for violent acts may be admissible, provided the defendant had knowledge of same, general proof of the victim’s criminal disposition is not. ""The decision in each case as to similar nature and remoteness, however, rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge.” (Commonwealth v Amos, 445 Pa 297, 305, supra.) In sum, then, we believe that our present rule precluding the admission of prior violent acts of victims in cases where a claim of justification is made should be changed to allow such evidence where it is shown that the defendant was actually aware of such particular acts at the time of the homicide or assault. Applying the new rule to the case before us, we conclude that a new trial is necessary. There is evidence in the record that the defendant killed his sister in the aftermath of a family dispute stimulated by the sister’s extreme aggravation over an asserted theft of money. The principal question of fact before the jury was whether the defendant shot his sister in self-defense, believing to be in imminent danger of an assault by the sister, or whether he shot her deliberately, without justification, after the family dispute had been broken off. Under these circumstances, the jury should be permitted to consider proof that the defendant was aware of his sister’s prior violent attacks upon her mother who, after all, was asserted by the sister to be the thief, and was, thus, the source of her anger. Since this evidence, if believed by the jury, would be probative on the reasonableness of defendant’s *554apprehension for his own safety, we are compelled to conclude that there is a significant probability that the jury might have credited the defense of justification had it been apprised of the victim’s prior acts of violence. (People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230, 242.) We do not, however, imply that at a new trial the court must admit into evidence all the instances which the defense sought to establish at the first trial. We hold simply that, under the newly announced rule, evidence of specific acts of violence committed by deceased should not be excluded if the evidence is relevant and probative to show the state of the defendant’s mind as to the necessity of defending himself. As previously noted, the trial court also has discretion in the extent and in a manner in which the incidents are sought to be proved. We have examined the other points advanced by the defendant and find that, in no respect, did the courts below fall into error. We reverse not because the courts below failed to properly administer the law, but because we believe the law itself should be changed, and that the defendant is entitled to the benefit of that change. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered. Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Cooke concur. Order reversed, etc. . Similar considerations, of course, obtain in prosecutions for assault. For convenience, we need only make reference to that type of case as is presently before us, homicide. . An examination of the more recent cases in other American jurisdictions is instructive. California, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin, North Carolina and one Federal court permit the introduction of evidence establishing specific violent acts of the victim, provided that the defendant knew of them. (See Cal Evidence Code, § 1103, subd [1]; People v Rowland, 262 Cal App 2d 790, 797; Commonwealth v Amos, 445 Pa 297; Ruffin v State, 50 Del 83 [where defendant was *550allowed to prove some specific acts, not error to preclude further inquiry into deceased’s criminal record]; Stover v Commonwealth, 211 Va 789, cert den 412 US 953; Wood v State, 486 SW2d 359 [Tex]; McMorris v State, 58 Wis 2d 144; State v Johnson, 270 NC 215; United States v Burks, 470 F2d 432; see, also, Mortimore v State, 24 Wyo 452; Mendez v State, 27 Ariz 82.) Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa and Louisiana have adhered to the rule of exclusion. (See Williamson v State, 25 Md App 338; State v Maggitt, 517 SW2d 105; Johnson v Commonwealth, 477 SW2d 159 [Ky]; State v Kimbrough, 173 Neb 873; State v Keaton, 258 Minn 359; State v Rhone, 223 Iowa 1221; People v Singleton, 311 So 2d 881 [La].) Several jurisdictions have adopted a middle ground, permitting the introduction of evidence relating to specific violent acts directed at the defendant, but excluding evidence of acts directed at third persons. (See People v Davis, 29 Ill 2d 127; People v Farrell, 137 Mich 127; Henley v State, 520 SW2d 361 [Tenn]; Chaffin v State, 209 Tenn 590.)

6620680_1,2464,"BROADDUS, J. This is an áction on a policy of insurance against accident and sickness made by the Northwestern Benevolent Society to the plaintiff on the 16th day of June, 1900. The defendant is the successor of said Northwestern Benevolent Society. By said policy the plaintiff was insured against loss by accident or sickness and in case of immediate or total disability by reason of injury suffered by him, so as to cause total loss of time and wholly prevent him from attending to or engaging in any business or occupation, a benefit of forty dollars per month, or at that rate for any part of a month should be paid to him for such total disability, and also a partial indemnity at one - fourth of said monthly rate for loss of time, by reason of a material but not a total disability not resulting immediately after an accident ; provided that the total of time for which indemnity shall be paid, for any one disabling injury shall not exceed one year, and only while the insured is under the strict care of a legally qualified surgeon. As the suit was instituted in a justice ’ s court defendant filed no answer, but judging from what appears in the record it denies all liability. The only evidence of the manner of plaintiff ’ s injury which he claims occurred on the 15th day of October, 1900, in the State of Texas, was his own. His statement was that he got on a freight train at Dallas for the purpose of going to Hearne, Texas ; that when the train got somewhere between forty and. seventy - five miles from Dallas the engine gave out at night on a curve at which time he heard a passenger train coming and apprehending danger of a collision he jumped off into a ditch about eight feet deep ; that in alighting he was injured in his breast and ankle ; and that afterwards he did not know what happened ; that he was taken out of the ditch by some one unknown to him, and taken to a farmhouse where he stayed about six or seven weeks. He says that then he still did not know anything — did not know where he was. He states that after he halfway came to his senses he thought of his * 414 "" wife and then he wanted to come home. He then came home and went to bed, after which, he went to sleep but awakened and said he did not know where he was — that he talked to his wife and did not know that he was talking to her, and did not know his whereabouts ; and that he got home on the last day of November, but he was not positive. This examination showed that he was uncertain as to the date of events if he was not simulating forgetfulness. It was shown that on the 1st day of December the defendant ’ s agent went to plaintiff ’ s home and received from plaintiff ’ s wife payment of existing dues, at which time said agent was aware of plaintiff ’ s condition. Up to this time plaintiff had given to defendant no - notice of his injury and loss, and he states his reason for not so doing in the following language, viz. : “ Well, I didn ’ t have any papers with me. I was unconscious. I didn ’ t know that I was insured, really. ’ ’ The defendant asked to have the statement of plaintiff stricken out for the reason that he had not provided against such a contingency in his contract, as an excuse for not giving notice as required by the policy. The court refused defendant ’ s request. Plaintiff further testified that he was at home a week or so before he recovered his mind ; that in a day or two thereafter he gave defendant notice of his injury by the accident ; that he made out his proof of loss upon a blank furnished to him by a Mr. Beedle, defendant ’ s agent in Kansas City ; and that he had no physician at any time until after he arrived home from Texas. ' Plaintiff ’ s report of his injury was sent to the company by defendant ’ s said agent Beedle on December 12th. On the 24th day of December, 1900, the defendant company notified the plaintiff in writing that it would not allow his claim for the reason that he had not filed in its office within ten days after the happening of the accident a report thereof. The defendant introduced several physicians at the trial whose testimony was to the effect that while * 415 • plaintiff ’ s injuries may have caused unconsciousness, it would not have lasted for the length of time claimed by him. It also introduced the evidence of railroad officials, the purport of which was that there had been no wreck on the road named by the plaintiff at the time he designated. In regard to this evidence of the physicians, _ we need only say that it was a question for the jury to determine whether it would believe them or the plaintiff. The evidence of the railroad officials may have been, and doubtless was true in every respect, yet it is not to be taken as overturning that of plaintiff for he did not say that he was in a wreck, but that he jumped under the impression that a wreck was impending. Defendant contends mainly that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for the following reasons, viz. : first, because he did not give defendant written notice within ten days after the happening of the accident and make his proof of loss as required by the terms of the policy ; second, because he did not have a surgeon in strict attendance upon himself during the time of his injury ; third, because the allegations of the petition are that he was injured in a railroad wreck, whereas the proof shows that there was no such wreck at the time. The latter objection only amounts to a variance between the proof and the allegations of the petition, to which defendant should have called the attention of the court at the time, as provided by section 655, Revised Statutes 1899 ' ; and having failed to do so, it has waived all error in that respect. In Whittemore v. Sills, 76 Mo. App. 248, this court held : “ While the law never imposes upon any one the duty to perform what is impossible, it allows people to enter into contracts as they please and the interference of third persons will not excuse performance. ” And that, ‘ ‘ when the law creates a duty and the party is disabled to ’ perform it, without any default in him, and he has no remedy over, the law will excuse him. But when a party by his own contract, creates a charge or duty * 416upon himself, he is bound to make it good, if he may, notwithstanding any accident, by inevitable necessity, because he might have provided against it by his contract. ” The court citing Davis v. Smith, 15 Mo. 467, Harrison v. Railroad, 74 Mo. 364. It was one of the conditions precedent to plaintiff ’ s right of recovery that he should give the requisite notice of the accident within ten days after the happening thereof. This was not done in this case because plaintiff ’ s evidence tended to show that he was rendered incapable of complying with that condition of his policy by reason of his mental incapacity caused by the accident itself. The plaintiff contends, and we think justly, that the foregoing rule does not apply to a case of this kind, for it certainly was not in the contemplation of the parties that if the accident for which the indemnity was provided should render the insured incapable of giving such notice that thereby defendant would escape liability. It is a rule of law in this State that “ Forfeitures in insurance policies are not favored and conditions which effect such forfeitures should be strongly construed against the party making them. ” And it was held that where “ an accident policy provided that in case of an injury totally disabling insured from carrying on his work, notice of the accident should immediately be given the company, and in case such injuries caused the death of the injured, notice should be given in like manner, that it was not necessary where the injuries caused death but did not totally disable the insured at the time from working, to give notice of the time it occurred, as the policy omitted to provide for any such notice. ” McFarland v. Accident Ins. Co., 124 Mo. 204. The case under consideration is similar on principle, as the policy fails to provide for such a condition as that which resulted to the plaintiff from the accident itself. It was one of the conditions imposed by the by - laws of the defendant and which the plaintiff accepted as a * 417part of Ms contract of insurance that no indemnity would be paid the insured on account of any sickness or disability, except for such time as he might be under the professional care of a physician or surgeon, which in case of injury should date from the first employment for professional purposes to the last call made by such sur ' geon. There was evidence that there was a physician or surgeon, in attendance upon plaintiff for only a part of the time for which he recovered indemnity. Whereas that fact would not preclude plaintiff from recovery under his proof, he should not be entitled to recover for the loss of time in which he had no surgeon as he was permitted to do. It is true that the court at the instance of defendant gave instruction number four which limited his right to recover for only such time as he was under the strict care of a qualified surgeon but the court also gave instruction number four on behalf of plaintiff allowing him to recover for the entire time he was wholly prevented by his injuries from engaging in business. This is claimed as prejudicial error and no doubt was, as the action was commenced in January, 1901, less than two months from the time that the plaintiff first had the care of a surgeon, whereas plaintiff recovered for the sum of $ 120, which amounted to an indemnity under the policy for a period of three months. The jury evidently disregarded defendant ’ s instruction, which was the law, and followed that of plaintiff, which, as we have seen, was not the law of the case. During the argument to the jury the counsel for plaintiff was reading from a law report an extract from a decision when defendant ’ s counsel objected to his action in so doing, whereupon the court after ascertaining that the book in question was a law report caused the said counsel to desist from further reading from said report, and instructed the jury to disregard what it had already heard. The court did all that could be done * 418under the circumstances, and it is more than probable that the jury was not influenced by such conduct upon the part of plaintiff ’ s counsel ; yet such a course of pracr tice is not to be encouraged, as it might impose upon the court the duty in some instances of reversing a cause. The defendant asked the court to define the term “ strict care ” as used in the policy, as “ immediate care, ” which the court refused because the definition would not enlighten the jury in that respect. The term “ strict care ” has no technical significance, but is to be interpreted as the language is usually understood. The defendant contends that plaintiff should have been required to prove that he made proper proof of loss of time, as a condition precedent to his right of recovery. As it was shown that defendant upon receiving notice of the accident in question denied all liability under the policy, it waived such proof. The law does not require the doing of an unnecessary act. Hoffman v. Acc. Ins. Co., 56 Mo. App. 301. The further point is made that it was not proved that the defendant had assumed the liabilities of the Northwestern Benevolent Society. As this proof can be supplied on a trial anew it has no significance at present. For the reasons given, the cause is reversed and remanded. All concur.",6620680," BROADDUS, J.

6508496_1,1143,"B. F. SAFFOLD, J. — I concur in the opinion of Justice Brickell, and, as a supplement to it, I read the following expression of my views on points not directly treated of by him. The indictment charged the defendant, under R. C. § 3564, in three counts, with accepting a bribe as solicitor of Dallas County. On the trial he denied his character as such solicitor, basing the denial on the fact that another was, at the time the offence was alleged to have been committed, the duly elected and qualified incumbent, and two persons could not hold the said office and perform the duties thereof at the same time. The state Constitution created the solicitor ’ s office ; and it requires that he shall be elected in each county by the electors thereof, and shall perform such duties as may be required of him by law. He shall hold office for a term of four years ; and in case of vacancy, such vacancy shall be filled by the judge of the circuit, until his successor is elected and qualified. The legislature has not prescribed the duties of this officer. All of the statutes in the Revised Code relate to the circuit solicitor then in existence. Many of them are inapplicable to the present county solicitor ; and such of them as have been applied to him in practice and usage have been so applied on account of their fitness to. the acquired meaning of the term “ solicitor, ” as a political officer of the State, rather than from any presumed or construed regulation of his duties by the legislature. Section 859 of the Revised Code, in authorizing the presiding judge, when the solicitor is absent, or it would be improper for him to act, to appoint a competent attorney in his place, only recognizes, or declares, what is the inherent right of the court. The court, as the guardian of justice, is the representative of all suitors, and, in criminal cases, it can suffer neither the State nor the accused to be undefended. As this section ( 859 ) was not adopted in direct application to the county solicitor, and is a part of the regulation of a distinct officer, it cannot have the effect to limit or vary the power which the court has inherently to supply the place of the county solicitor who for any cause is not acting. As the Constitution bestows the * 325power of appointment, in case of a vacancy, on the judge of the circuit, and it is the duty of that judge to see to the proper enforcement of the criminal law, both in term time and in vacation, except when he is displaced in term time by a presiding judge, an appointment of solicitor made by him at any time cannot technically be said to be void. The duties of solicitor are not confined in performance to the terms of the court ; for instance, he must issue subpoenas in vacation to witnesses to appear before the grand jury. When he is not acting, unless the judge of the circuit can supply his place, no other is authorized to do so, and there must be a failure of justice. The conclusion is, that the judge of the circuit, from his power to appoint to a vacancy, and his duty as a conservator of the peace, must be authorized to supply any lapse in the service of the solicitor ; and that, having jurisdiction of the subject matter, no appointment he may make is ip > so facto void, however irregular and subject to be set aside. If, then, the party appointed accepts the position, and performs the duties of the office, and while in the exercise of the rights, privileges, and responsibilities thereof, commits, as such officer, what the law denominates crime, he cannot defend on the ground that he was not solicitor de jure. As to whether the defendant was appointed to the office charged in the indictment to have been held by him, the transcript shows the following : “ April 1st, 1870. Ordered, J. S. Diggs, Esq., act as solicitor pro tem. of this court, until further ordered. ” “ At Chambers, October 17th, 1870. Ordered, That the order heretofore made appointing Sheppard S. Diggs solicitor pro tem. of this court until further ordered, be hereby revoked, and that S. W. John be appointed solicitor pro tem. until further order. ” Whether the appointment thus made ought to be construed as filling entirely the office of county solicitor temporarily of not, it authorized the appointee to act as such in matters pertaining to the Circuit Court, and was color of title for as much more as he assumed to do. Therefore, proof of such an appointment, and of acceptance and service under it by the defendant, would constitute him a defacto county solicitor, and subject to prosecution for malfeasance. That a de facto officer is subject to all the pains and penalties of a de jure officer is abundantly shown by the following authorities : 1 Bish. Crim. Law, § 917 ; 2 Bish. Crim. Law, § 378 ; 1 Gab. Crim. Law, 783 ; The State v. McEntyre, 3 Ired. 171, 174 ; The State v. Sellers, 7 Rich. 368, 372 ; People v. Cook, 4 Seld. 67 ; Rex v. Borrett, 6 Car. & P. 124 ; 3 Hawkins Pl. C. 261, § 28.",6508496," B. F. SAFFOLD, J. — I concur in the opinion of Justice Brickell, and, as a supplement to it, I read the following expression of my views on points not directly treated of by him. The indictment charged the defendant, under R. C. § 3564, in three counts, with accepting a bribe as solicitor of Dallas County. On the trial he denied his character as such solicitor, basing the denial on the fact that another was, at the time the offence was alleged to have been committed, the duly elected and qualified incumbent, and two persons could not hold the said office and perform the duties thereof at the same time. The state Constitution created the solicitor’s office ; and it requires that he shall be elected in each county by the electors thereof, and shall perform such duties as may be required of him by law. He shall hold office for a term of four years; and in case of vacancy, such vacancy shall be filled by the judge of the circuit, until his successor is elected and qualified. The legislature has not prescribed the duties of this officer. All of the statutes in the Revised Code relate to the circuit solicitor then in existence. Many of them are inapplicable to the present county solicitor; and such of them as have been applied to him in practice and usage have been so applied on account of their fitness to. the acquired meaning of the term “ solicitor,” as a political officer of the State, rather than from any presumed or construed regulation of his duties by the legislature. Section 859 of the Revised Code, in authorizing the presiding judge, when the solicitor is absent, or it would be improper for him to act, to appoint a competent attorney in his place, only recognizes, or declares, what is the inherent right of the court. The court, as the guardian of justice, is the representative of all suitors, and, in criminal cases, it can suffer neither the State nor the accused to be undefended. As this section (859) was not adopted in direct application to the county solicitor, and is a part of the regulation of a distinct officer, it cannot have the effect to limit or vary the power which the court has inherently to supply the place of the county solicitor who for any cause is not acting. As the Constitution bestows the *325power of appointment, in case of a vacancy, on the judge of the circuit, and it is the duty of that judge to see to the proper enforcement of the criminal law, both in term time and in vacation, except when he is displaced in term time by a presiding judge, an appointment of solicitor made by him at any time cannot technically be said to be void. The duties of solicitor are not confined in performance to the terms of the court; for instance, he must issue subpoenas in vacation to witnesses to appear before the grand jury. When he is not acting, unless the judge of the circuit can supply his place, no other is authorized to do so, and there must be a failure of justice. The conclusion is, that the judge of the circuit, from his power to appoint to a vacancy, and his duty as a conservator of the peace, must be authorized to supply any lapse in the service of the solicitor; and that, having jurisdiction of the subject matter, no appointment he may make is ip>so facto void, however irregular and subject to be set aside. If, then, the party appointed accepts the position, and performs the duties of the office, and while in the exercise of the rights, privileges, and responsibilities thereof, commits, as such officer, what the law denominates crime, he cannot defend on the ground that he was not solicitor de jure. As to whether the defendant was appointed to the office charged in the indictment to have been held by him, the transcript shows the following: “ April 1st, 1870. Ordered, J. S. Diggs, Esq., act as solicitor pro tem. of this court, until further ordered.” “ At Chambers, October 17th, 1870. Ordered, That the order heretofore made appointing Sheppard S.

8124477_1,1838,"Wallace,. 1. The demurrer to the complaint raises tbe question whether the plaintiff can recover as for money had and received, upon the following facts : In May, 1883, the defendants sought subscriptions to a loan to be made to it of $ 2, 000, 000, to aid in constructing the railroad of the Mexican National Bailway Company, and on May 30, 1883, the plaintiff became a subscriber to the extent of $ 25, 000, upon the terms of a contract of subscription. By this contract the defendant agreed to deposit in trust with a trustee named certain securities, aggregating in nominal value $ 20, 000, 000, as collateral for the repayment of the $ 2, 000, 000 loan on or before * 523September 15, 1884. On October 1, 1883, the plaintiff had paid the amount subscribed by him in installments, as called by the defendant, and had received receipts therefor, which were not transferable without the consent of the defendant. It was provided by the contract of subscription that such receipts should be exchanged for formal certificates of interest in the loan authenticated by the trustee, upon payment of the last installment of the subscription. Before the payment of the last installment by the plaintiff the defendant transferred to the trustee named in the contract the securities specified therein, but this was done by a trust indenture which prescribed the powers and duties of the trustee respecting the use and sale of the securities. Among other tilings, this trust indenture provided that the trustee should execute from time to time, as requested by defendant, certificates of interest entitling the registered holders to an interest in the securities, or the proceeds thereof in case of a sale by him “ under the provisions of the trust indenture, ” bearing the same proportion to the whole as the amount of each certificate should bear to $ 2, 000, 000. The indenture also provided that the trustee should not sell the securities to satisfy the loan unless holders of certificates representing 25 per cent, of the whole amount should request him to do so ; and it also provided that the holders of a majority in interest might waive any default in the payment of the loan on the part of the defendant, or instruct the trustee to do so, and extend the defendant ’ s time for payment, and suspend or postpone the sale by the trustee of the collaterals at their discretion. So far as appears, the plaintiff was ignorant of the terms of the indenture when he paid the installments of his subscription, but, after it was executed, demanded a certificate of defendant of the character specified in the contract of subscription. The defendant refused such a certificate, but offered one such as it had authorized the trustee to execute by the terms of the trust indenture. The first question is whether the deposit made of the collaterals under the terms of the trust indenture was such a departure from tlio contract of subscription as to amount to a breach of that contract. The contract was silent as to the conditions upon which the bonds should be deposited with the trustee, aside from the stipulation that the loan should be secured by an assignment in trust of the specified collaterals which were to be deposited with the trustee. The reasonable implification, however, is that they were to be deposited to secure the repayment of the loan on the contract day, and that the trustee was to exercise the ordinary rights of a pledgee to sell the securities and satisfy the debt for the benefit of tlio subscribers. Such a pledge would, doubtless, confer upon every subscriber a qualified right to call upon the trustee to satisfy the amount due to him by a sale of the securities. But the fund created was a joint fund for the benefit and protection of the whole body of subscribers, and therefore is not to be dealt with upon the intervention of a single cestui * 524que trust to tbe disadvantage of the. others. If the trust indenture provided that the trustee should not sell the securities unless a sale should be advantageous to the common interests of the cestuis que trust, it would be unobjectionable, because it would only prescribe a condition which would be implied, and which a court of equity would impose in the exercise of its jurisdiction over trusts, if applied to by any of the parties in interest. But the indenture contains arbitrary restrictions upon the powers of the trustee, which he cannot disregard, and which materially impair the rights of the subscribers. It substitutes the discretion of 25 per cent, in interest of the cestuis que trust in place of the discretion of the trustee, and requires him, at the intervention of a majority of the subscribers, to extend the time of payment, and postpone a sale of the securities. The plaintiff did not consent to the creation of such a trust. The conditions may have been designed to promote the best interests of all the subscribers ; they may have been wise and expedient, but they were not such as were authorized by the plaintiffs contract. A court of equity might reform the terms of the trust indenture if a suit were brought for that purpose, but, so long as they stand, would have to adhere to them, if called upon to intervene upon the application of the cestuis que trust. It remains to consider whether the plaintiff can recover back his money in an action for money had and received, or whether his remedy is merely one for damages for a breach of contract. The subscription agreement was a separate and independent contract between the defendant and each subscriber. The defendant could maintain a suit against each subscriber upon his failure to pay the amount of the subscription ; and it must follow that each subscriber has a corresponding right of action against the defendant for any breach of the contract on its part towards him. Similar contracts have been frequently adjudged to confer a several liability and a several - right of action on the part of each subscriber. Thomp. Liab. Stockh. § 114 ; Whittlesey v. Frantz, 74 N. Y. 456. It is a familiar rule that when one party to an executory contract puts ' it out of his power to perform it, the other may regard it as terminated, and has an immediate right of action to recover whatever damages he has sustained.

They were to be exchanged for formal certificates, but when the defendant had put. it beyond its power to deliver the proper certificates, the plaintiff was not bound to tender them. No demand of the certificates was necessary after defendant had incapacitated itself from giving them. Where money is advanced upon an executory contract, which the contracting party fails to perform, * 525It is in the election of the other party either to sue upon the agreement and recover damages for a breach, or to treat the contract as rescinded, and recover back his money as paid upon a consideration hick lias failed.

9694288_1,3668,"OPINION NEWMAN, Justice. The Commonwealth appeals the Superior Court ’ s Order of March 15, 1994, vacating the judgment of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County ( trial court ) against Charles Gordon ( Gordon ) for receiving stolen property, 1 and remanding the matter for a new trial. We reverse. FACTS The record reveals that on December 8, 1991, Philadelphia police officer Frank Pavgouzas received police radio information that a white male, approximately twenty years old with blond hair, wearing a. gray or brown jacket and jeans, had snatched a purse from Cathy Babe ( victim ). Officer Pavgouzas arrived at the crime scene, near Frankford and Cheltenham Avenues, within five minutes of receiving the call. The officer proceeded to a rear alley where an elderly man told him that a man fitting the description of the perpetrator had been living in an abandoned house down the alley. * 69As Officer Pavgouzas walked through the alley, he observed a house that stood out from the rest of the row houses on the block because the exterior of the house was extremely dilapidated, there were no window treatments and knee - high weeds covered the yard. The rear door was open and the top door hinge had broken away from the door frame. Officer Pavgouzas entered the kitchen of the house and observed that the sink was filled with dirt, trash was piled throughout the room, and there were no kitchen appliances. When hearing a television in the next room, Officer Pavgouzas pushed aside a sheet hanging from a doorway leading to the dining room. The officer observed a near empty room with a television on a milk crate, a lamp, a “ beer ball ” and a black pocketbook lying on the floor. He saw no personal effects such as clothing, mail or other furniture in the room. Gordon, a blond - haired young man wearing a brown jacket and blue pants, was sitting on a mattress on the floor. Officer Pavgouzas ordered Gordon to stand up and the officer observed a blue change purse that was underneath Gordon on the mattress. The officer opened the blue change purse and found the identification of the victim. He ordered Gordon to leave the house, radioed the officer who was with the victim and asked him to bring the victim to the scene. She arrived and identified Gordon as the man who grabbed her purse, and she also identified the black pocketbook and blue change purse as her property. PROCEDURAL HISTORY Gordon filed a motion to suppress evidence found in the house. The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, sitting as a suppression court ( suppression court ) denied Gordon ’ s motion to suppress, holding that the warrantless search of the house did not violate Gordon ’ s rights under either the Fourth Amendment of the U. S. Constitution or Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Following a non - jury trial, the trial court found Gordon guilty of receiving * 70stolen property, but acquitted him of robbery2 and simple assault. 3 The trial court denied Gordon ’ s post - verdict motion challenging the constitutionality of the warrantless search of the house and sentenced him to five years of probation. The Superior Court reversed the suppression court ’ s denial of Gordon ’ s motion to suppress, vacated the trial court ’ s judgment of sentence and remanded the matter for a new trial. 4 The Superior Court held that the police violated Gordon ’ s right to be free from unreasonable governmental searches and seizures under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Commonwealth filed a timely Petition for Allowance of Appeal challenging the Superior Court ’ s conclusion that Gordon had a constitutionally protected zone of privacy in a room of an abandoned house. ISSUE We must decide whether an individual has a reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy in a room of an abandoned5 house under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. DISCUSSION Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides as follows : Security from Searches and Seizures Section 8. The people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches and seizures, and no warrant to search any place or to seize any person or things shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation subscribed to by the affiant. * 71Evidence discovered as a result of a search that violates the fundamental constitutional guarantees of Article I, Section 8 will be suppressed. Commonwealth v. Chambers, 528 Pa. 403, 598 A. 2d 539 ( 1991 ). We note that in Pennsylvania any defendant charged with a possessory crime, including receiving stolen property, has automatic standing to challenge a search and seizure under Article I, Section 8. Commonwealth v. Sell, 504 Pa. 46, 470 A. 2d 457 ( 1983 ). In Commonwealth v. Peterson, 535 Pa. 492, 636 A. 2d 615 ( 1993 ), we held that a warrantless police search of an abandoned storefront does not violate Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In Peterson, a police officer approached a “ gate house ” to make a controlled purchase of cocaine using a ten dollar bill marked with indelible ink, which was activated by perspiration to become blue dye. 6 After exchanging the ten dollar bill for a package of white powder, police entered the gate house without a warrant and found the defendant in a back room with blue dye on his body. The trial court denied the defendant ’ s motion to suppress, found him guilty of delivery and possession with intent to deliver cocaine, and sentenced him to three to six years imprisonment. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. On appeal, we analyzed the defendant ’ s claim that the police violated his rights under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution using a twofold test. That test requires a person to ( 1 ) have exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy and ( 2 ) have demonstrated that the expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable and legitimate. Peterson. The defendant bears the burden of proving that his subjective expectation of privacy is one that society is willing to recognize as legitimate. 7 Id. The defen * 72dant must establish more than just a subjective expectation of freedom from intrusion, because [ a ] burglar plying his trade in a summer cabin during the off season may have a thoroughly justified subjective expectation of privacy, but it is not one which the law recognizes as ‘ legitimate. ’ Peterson, 535 Pa. at 500, 636 A. 2d at 619, quoting Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128, 143 n. 12, 99 S. Ct. 421, 430 n. 12, 58 L. Ed. 2d 387 ( 1978 ). We consider the totality of the circumstances and carefully weigh the societal interests involved when determining the legitimacy of such an expectation. Peterson. Particularly, a defendant must establish a possessory interest, a legitimate presence, or some “ factor from which a reasonable and justifiable expectation of privacy could be deduced ” to prove that this subjective expectation of privacy is legitimate. Peterson, 535 Pa. at 501, 636 A. 2d at 619. In Peterson, we referred to Commonwealth v. Cameron, 385 Pa. Super. 492, 561 A. 2d 783 ( 1989 ), alloc. denied, 525 Pa. 576, 575 A. 2d 108 ( 1990 ), a Superior Court case with a similar fact pattern. The Superior Court in Cameron overruled the trial court, who granted the defendant ’ s motion to suppress evidence found by the police when they entered an abandoned house without a warrant. After finding packets of cocaine that Cameron had thrown behind a couch, the police arrested him. The trial court granted the defendant ’ s motion to suppress, holding that the presence of a working television, a couch and food exhibited that the abandoned house was a dwelling place and was accordingly protected by Article I, Section 8. When reversing the trial court, the Superior Court acknowledged that Cameron manifested a subjective expectation of privacy by keeping a television, couch and food in the abandoned house. However, the Superior Court held that while Cameron did not need to show a property interest, he did need to establish some legal or defacto right to control the premises at issue to establish a reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy. Because there was no evidence of Cameron ’ s right to control the house, the Superior Court concluded that society was not willing to recognize his subjec * 73tive expectation of privacy in the abandoned house as legitimate. Similar to Cameron, the defendant in Peterson did not establish either a possessory interest, a legitimate presence or a characteristic of ownership in the abandoned storefront from which society could recognize an expectation of privacy. Thus, he did not prove that his expectation of privacy was legitimate. As this legitimacy is the “ sine qua non for establishing that the government ’ s intrusion was unlawful, ” Peterson, 535 Pa. at 501, 636 A. 2d at 619, we held that the warrantless police entry into an abandoned storefront where drugs were being sold did not violate Article I, Section 8 ’ s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. Peterson. With this analysis in mind, we now examine the suppression court ’ s decision to deny Gordon ’ s motion to suppress the evidence discovered in the dining room of the abandoned house. When reviewing the suppression court ’ s denial of a motion to suppress, the “ appellate court ’ s responsibility is to determine whether the record supports the factual findings of the suppression court and the legitimacy of the inferences and legal conclusions drawn from those findings. ” Peterson, 535 Pa. at 496, 636 A. 2d at 617. Here, the suppression court concluded that although Gordon may have had a subjective expectation of privacy in a room of the abandoned house, he did not carry his burden of proving that his subjective expectation of privacy is one society is willing to recognize as legitimate. At the suppression hearing, Gordon did not present any witnesses and the Commonwealth presented only one witness, Officer Pavgouzas. Gordon asserts that the officer ’ s testimony concerning the presence of a sheet separating his room from the rest of the house, electricity, a mattress and a television, was sufficient to prove that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in the dining room of the abandoned house. We do not disagree. However, Gordon must also establish that his subjective expectation of privacy is legitimate before we will declare the * 74warrantless police search of the dining room to be a violation of his rights under Article I, Section 8. As previously discussed, to prove a legitimate expectation of privacy in a structure, a defendant must establish that he has either a possessory interest or a legitimate presence, or he must establish some factor from which a reasonable and justified expectation of privacy can be deduced. Peterson. Here, Gordon concedes that he had no property interest in the abandoned structure. Gordon has never argued that he had an ownership interest such as seisin or adverse possession. Also, there was no evidence that Gordon had a legal right to enter or use the building or that he was legitimately on the premises. We will therefore examine the totality of the circumstances to determine if Gordon established some possessorybased factor from which we could find a reasonable expectation of privacy. Id. Gordon argues that his obvious and known use of the vacant building as a dwelling place created a reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy thus invoking the protections of Article I, Section 8. Gordon suggests that if a structure looks like it is being used as a home, then it is a home. However, we held in Peterson that mere use of property, as exhibited by the presence of attributes of a home, is not a sufficient characteristic of ownership that would evidence a legitimate expectation of privacy protected by Article I, Section 8. Accordingly, Gordon must identify some other factor from which we can ascertain a legitimate expectation of privacy. In analyzing whether a claimant has established a factor from which society could find a legitimate expectation of privacy, we are guided by the U. S. Supreme Court, which noted : One of the main rights attaching to property is the right to exclude others, see W. Blackstone, Commentaries, Book 2, ch. l, and one who owns or lawfully possesses or controls property will in all likelihood have a legitimate expectation of privacy by virtue of this right to exclude. Expectations * 75of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment, of course, need not be based on a common - law interest in real or personal property, or on the invasion of such an interest.... But by focusing on legitimate expectations of privacy in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the Court has not altogether abandoned use of property concepts in determining the presence or absence of the privacy interests protected by that Amendment. Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. at 143 n. 12, 99 S. Ct. at 430 n. 12 ( 1978 ). Therefore, a defendant can establish a legitimate expectation of privacy, despite lacking a common - law interest in the real property, if he demonstrates certain characteristics of ownership. Among the critical characteristics of ownership is the right to exclude others from the premises in question. Rakas ; Cameron. Here, for example, the Superior Court concluded that the sheet hanging from the doorway in the kitchen effectively closed the room off from the rest of the house and society. The Superior Court clearly interpreted the presence of the sheet as an indication of Gordon ’ s right to exclude other people from the dining room in the abandoned house. However, we do not agree that Gordon sustained his burden of proving that the sheet served to exclude others from the dining room. Gordon did not present any testimony that he excluded other people living in the house from the dining room. Furthermore, as there was no testimony that Gordon hung the sheet himself, there was no reason for the Superior Court to conclude this sheet evidenced Gordon ’ s right to exclude others. Finally, Gordon ’ s claimed exclusion of the public from the dining room is implausible because the evidence revealed that the house had an unlocked, open exterior door. Thus, Gordon failed to produce sufficient evidence that the sheet hanging in the interior doorway of the open abandoned house exhibited his right to exclude others from the room in which he was claiming a legitimate expectation of privacy. In the alternative, Gordon urges this Court to recognize a legitimate expectation of privacy in the room of the * 76abandoned house to respect the dignity of the homeless. However we find Gordon ’ s argument on behalf of the homeless disingenuous in light of Gordon ’ s testimony that he has a residence and a job. He testified at the sentencing hearing that he lives with his common - law wife and their three children at his wife ’ s grandmother ’ s house. Additionally, his attorney indicated at the sentencing hearing that Gordon ’ s family life is so stable that house arrest during his probation was not necessary. Also, Gordon testified at trial that he was a self - employed electrician who earned between $ 200. 00 and $ 300. 00 a week in non - reported income. Consequently, Gordon ’ s advocacy on behalf of the homeless rings hollow. We conclude that, like the defendants in Cameron and Peterson, Gordon here has failed to prove that he has either a possessory interest, a legitimate presence or any factor from which society could recognize a reasonable expectation of privacy in the room in the abandoned house. Thus, we agree with the suppression court that although Gordon may have established a subjective expectation of privacy in the dining room of the abandoned house, he did not meet his burden of proving an expectation of privacy that society is willing to recognize as legitimate. 8 Therefore, the officer ’ s warrantless search of the house did not violate Gordon ’ s rights under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The suppression court properly denied Gordon ’ s Motion to Suppress. Accordingly, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court and reinstate the trial court ’ s judgment of sentence. NIX, Former C.

We do not decide whether under other circumstances an individual living in an abandoned structure might demonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy under Article I, Section 8.",9694288," OPINION NEWMAN, Justice. The Commonwealth appeals the Superior Court’s Order of March 15,1994, vacating the judgment of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (trial court) against Charles Gordon (Gordon) for receiving stolen property,1 and remanding the matter for a new trial. We reverse. FACTS The record reveals that on December 8, 1991, Philadelphia police officer Frank Pavgouzas received police radio information that a white male, approximately twenty years old with blond hair, wearing a .gray or brown jacket and jeans, had snatched a purse from Cathy Babe (victim). Officer Pavgouzas arrived at the crime scene, near Frankford and Cheltenham Avenues, within five minutes of receiving the call. The officer proceeded to a rear alley where an elderly man told him that a man fitting the description of the perpetrator had been living in an abandoned house down the alley. *69As Officer Pavgouzas walked through the alley, he observed a house that stood out from the rest of the row houses on the block because the exterior of the house was extremely dilapidated, there were no window treatments and knee-high weeds covered the yard. The rear door was open and the top door hinge had broken away from the door frame. Officer Pavgouzas entered the kitchen of the house and observed that the sink was filled with dirt, trash was piled throughout the room, and there were no kitchen appliances. When hearing a television in the next room, Officer Pavgouzas pushed aside a sheet hanging from a doorway leading to the dining room. The officer observed a near empty room with a television on a milk crate, a lamp, a “beer ball” and a black pocketbook lying on the floor. He saw no personal effects such as clothing, mail or other furniture in the room. Gordon, a blond-haired young man wearing a brown jacket and blue pants, was sitting on a mattress on the floor. Officer Pavgouzas ordered Gordon to stand up and the officer observed a blue change purse that was underneath Gordon on the mattress. The officer opened the blue change purse and found the identification of the victim. He ordered Gordon to leave the house, radioed the officer who was with the victim and asked him to bring the victim to the scene. She arrived and identified Gordon as the man who grabbed her purse, and she also identified the black pocketbook and blue change purse as her property. PROCEDURAL HISTORY Gordon filed a motion to suppress evidence found in the house. The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, sitting as a suppression court (suppression court) denied Gordon’s motion to suppress, holding that the warrantless search of the house did not violate Gordon’s rights under either the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Following a non-jury trial, the trial court found Gordon guilty of receiving *70stolen property, but acquitted him of robbery2 and simple assault.3 The trial court denied Gordon’s post-verdict motion challenging the constitutionality of the warrantless search of the house and sentenced him to five years of probation. The Superior Court reversed the suppression court’s denial of Gordon’s motion to suppress, vacated the trial court’s judgment of sentence and remanded the matter for a new trial.4 The Superior Court held that the police violated Gordon’s right to be free from unreasonable governmental searches and seizures under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Commonwealth filed a timely Petition for Allowance of Appeal challenging the Superior Court’s conclusion that Gordon had a constitutionally protected zone of privacy in a room of an abandoned house. ISSUE We must decide whether an individual has a reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy in a room of an abandoned5 house under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. DISCUSSION Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides as follows: Security from Searches and Seizures Section 8. The people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches and seizures, and no warrant to search any place or to seize any person or things shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation subscribed to by the affiant. *71Evidence discovered as a result of a search that violates the fundamental constitutional guarantees of Article I, Section 8 will be suppressed. Commonwealth v. Chambers, 528 Pa. 403, 598 A.2d 539 (1991). We note that in Pennsylvania any defendant charged with a possessory crime, including receiving stolen property, has automatic standing to challenge a search and seizure under Article I, Section 8. Commonwealth v. Sell, 504 Pa. 46, 470 A.2d 457 (1983). In Commonwealth v. Peterson, 535 Pa. 492, 636 A.2d 615 (1993), we held that a warrantless police search of an abandoned storefront does not violate Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In Peterson, a police officer approached a “gate house” to make a controlled purchase of cocaine using a ten dollar bill marked with indelible ink, which was activated by perspiration to become blue dye.6 After exchanging the ten dollar bill for a package of white powder, police entered the gate house without a warrant and found the defendant in a back room with blue dye on his body. The trial court denied the defendant’s motion to suppress, found him guilty of delivery and possession with intent to deliver cocaine, and sentenced him to three to six years imprisonment. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. On appeal, we analyzed the defendant’s claim that the police violated his rights under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution using a twofold test. That test requires a person to (1) have exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy and (2) have demonstrated that the expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable and legitimate.

6180733_1,2031,"Hugh S. Coyle, J. The plaintiff landowner brings this action in equity to enjoin and restrain defendants, sued individually, and as the Board of Education of Union Free School District No. 5 of the Village of Ardsley, from casting and diverting surface drainage waters from defendant ’ s school property into a pond located to the north of land of the plaintiff, and in which pond or lake the plaintiff has certain easement rights. Alternative relief for money damages in the sum of $ 25, 000 is claimed by the plaintiff. It has been stipulated by the attorneys for the respective parties that the action is to be determined upon the question of damages resulting from the casting of surface waters only upon plaintiff ’ s premises. The action was tried by the court without a jury and the facts show that plaintiff acquired title to his property in September of * 3401952. By the deed of conveyance he was granted easements in, and to, a pond covering about one acre of land located as aforesaid to the north of plaintiff ’ s land. Said pond has a depth of from 1 to 10 feet, is oval in shape and extends for approximately 160 feet along plaintiff ’ s land and is separated from plaintiff ’ s land by a dam or dike on one face of the pond. The easement rights as contained in plaintiff ’ s deed are as follows : ‘ ‘ The above described premises are conveyed subject to the fact that the above premises border on or touch upon a pond, and it is agreed between the grantors and grantees that all owners of land bordering upon or touching upon the pond shall have a common casement to the said pond area and that no person owning land which abuts the said pond shall change the contours or depth of the said pond without the written consent of all owners of other lands abutting the said pond ”. It should be observed that the land of the defendant does not physically abut the pond, and the waters draining from defendant ’ s property cross under a roadway through and under lands of others into the pond. At the end of the pond nearest plaintiff ’ s property, the dam or dike hereinbefore referred to consists of a rubble wall, approximately 3 feet wide, and about 9 to 10 feet hi depth extending along plaintiff ’ s property in front of which there exists an outlet stream or channel and both the dam and the stream or channel designed to receive the overflow from the pond have been in existence for a period of approximately 50 years. Plaintiff constructed a residence on his land and installed a swimming pool and made expenditures for planting, seeding and landscaping. He also testified that he made intermittent use of the pond until approximately 1958 when defendant ’ s property was acquired for school purposes and upon which a school building and other facilities were subsequently installed. The school premises of the defendant lie a distance north of the pond and are substantially higher in el ovation than plaintiff ’ s land and the testimony shows that the elevation, if anything, has been reduced rather than increased by the installation of the school facilities and the adoption of the drainage plan. In improving the school site and the surrounding areas it is alleged that defendants caused the surface waters which would normally flow from the area to bo diverted from their natural course by the use of pipes, catch basins and other artificial channels thereby causing an excessive amount of water to flow into said pond, resulting in an overflow onto plaintiff ’ s land and causing damage to his property. In substance, defendant is an upland owner, and its property is separated from the area of the pond by intervening land owned by others. It is claimed, * 341among other things, that the channeling of surface waters by artificial means off of defendant ’ s lands concentrates the flow of water, and thus raises the pond level to a point where the natural overflow gate and drainage channel in front of the dam or wall cannot absorb the waters thus caused to overflow. There is no contention here that waters other than those naturally flowing to the pond area prior to the construction of the school are now caused to enter the pond. Plaintiff ’ s theory seems to be that the concentrated collection of waters through the installation of catch basins and pipes causes water eventually to enter into the pond with greater force at a given time than otherwise would be the case ; that defendant ’ s acts in channeling the waters prevent a more natural or slower flow into the pond by reducing the degree of natural absorption. It is defendant ’ s position that in laying out the school site engineers and qualified experts were requested to submit a drainage and site plan ; the severity of the slope existing prior to plaintiff ’ s construction was reduced and that the net result of the plan finally adopted was to improve the drainage situation with respect to its land, the land of other owners and the pond, and not to interfere with or to damage surrounding properties. Our highest courts have determined the law in this State with respect to the rights of lower and upper owners to improve their lands, and recent cases have contained a full discussion of the rights of property owners in connection with this vexatious problem, to wit, the disposition and flow of surface waters. It is now established that our courts have adopted the so - called “ common law ” rule in order to avoid discrimination against a lower proprietor. Under the “ civil law ” as distinguished from the ‘ ‘ common law ’ ’ the upper owner was held to be the dominant estate and the lower property owner held to be the servient estate. Under the common law neither holds a dominant or servient estate or position with respect to the other. Both have equal rights to improve their property come what may to the surface water, provided the improvements are made in good faith to fit the property for some rational use to which it is adapted and that the water is not drained into the other ’ s property by artificial means, such as pipes and ditches. It seems apparent that no question of good faith on the part of the defendant is here present. The question for determination is whether or not the defendant in improving its land, and admittedly with the use of artificial means such as catch basins and pipes, thereby caused the discharge of waters into the pond and then onto plaintiff ’ s land which otherwise would not have occurred had the land been left in its original state. There is * 342testimony in the record that at all times prior to the school improvement a water. channel or pipe of substantial size crossed under the roadway immediately to the south of defendant ’ s property and carried the drainage waters into a swale or swampy area and eventually into the pond. All parties admit that the pond is the natural drainage area for the premises in question. Some testimony was adduced indicating that there was another area of drainage by natural means prior to the improvements made by the municipality and by the School District, but the testimony indicates that as to this portion of the improvement the drainage waters so - called were and are diverted from eventual entry into the pond rather than channeled into it. The testimony as to the evidence of additional waters being cast into the pond or natural dranage area resulting from the improvement of the school property is fragmentary and far from conclusive. True it is that testimony was elicited that the rubble wall forming the dam or dike emitted waters when the pond was high, usually following a torrential down pour or heavy run - off from melting snow or ice. This condition, however, existed prior to the improvement of defendant ’ s property and there is no tangible evidence in the record indicating that it exists in a greater degree following the improvement than it did prior thereto. A long - time resident of the area testified that he had observed leaking in the dam itself, with water spouting intermittently therefrom for a period exceeding 25 years. The burden cast upon the plaintiff to show that in fact the acts of the defendant caused the level of the water in the pond to be unnaturally raised has not been met. It was likewise testified upon the trial that the raising and lowering device situate approximately midway in the wall or dike had in the past overflowed and that the drainage ditch or channel parallel to and immediately south of the Avail or dike had been, on occasions prior to defendant ’ s construction, inadequate to accept and handle the surface waters draining from the area north of the pond. This court is aware of the limitation of the rights of a property OAvner in disposing of surface waters where the water is collected and drained onto other property by means of pipes or ditches, and is likewise aAvare that the waters here are in fact handled in and out by pipes and artificial means, to cause them to flow into the pond and the natural drainage area, but no proof has been offered to indicate that the acts of the defendant have caused a condition to arise differing from that which existed prior to defendant ’ s improvement of its property. Likewise, it has not been established that any deleterious effect or damage was caused to the dike or dam by reason of the installa * 343tion of the drainage system as it now exists and the collection of waters artificially with possible additional force. An inspection of the premises by the court, with the consent of all parties, bears out the court ’ s view of the testimony given at the trial and of the conclusions reached herein. It is unfortunate that all parties in interest are unable to properly repair the rubble wall or dike in question which would seem to be a solution to the problem, coupled with a repair of the drain - off channel immediately to the south of the rubble wall. This court, however, on the evidence presented may not assist the parties in that regard for the reason that plaintiff has shown no actionable wrong on the part of the defendant herein. Plaintiff ’ s claim for injunctive relief is denied as is plaintiff ’ s alternate claim for damages.",6180733," Hugh S. Coyle, J. The plaintiff landowner brings this action in equity to enjoin and restrain defendants, sued individually, and as the Board of Education of Union Free School District No. 5 of the Village of Ardsley, from casting and diverting surface drainage waters from defendant’s school property into a pond located to the north of land of the plaintiff, and in which pond or lake the plaintiff has certain easement rights. Alternative relief for money damages in the sum of $25,000 is claimed by the plaintiff. It has been stipulated by the attorneys for the respective parties that the action is to be determined upon the question of damages resulting from the casting of surface waters only upon plaintiff’s premises. The action was tried by the court without a jury and the facts show that plaintiff acquired title to his property in September of *3401952. By the deed of conveyance he was granted easements in, and to, a pond covering about one acre of land located as aforesaid to the north of plaintiff’s land. Said pond has a depth of from 1 to 10 feet, is oval in shape and extends for approximately 160 feet along plaintiff’s land and is separated from plaintiff’s land by a dam or dike on one face of the pond. The easement rights as contained in plaintiff’s deed are as follows: ‘ ‘ The above described premises are conveyed subject to the fact that the above premises border on or touch upon a pond, and it is agreed between the grantors and grantees that all owners of land bordering upon or touching upon the pond shall have a common casement to the said pond area and that no person owning land which abuts the said pond shall change the contours or depth of the said pond without the written consent of all owners of other lands abutting the said pond ”. It should be observed that the land of the defendant does not physically abut the pond, and the waters draining from defendant’s property cross under a roadway through and under lands of others into the pond. At the end of the pond nearest plaintiff’s property, the dam or dike hereinbefore referred to consists of a rubble wall, approximately 3 feet wide, and about 9 to 10 feet hi depth extending along plaintiff’s property in front of which there exists an outlet stream or channel and both the dam and the stream or channel designed to receive the overflow from the pond have been in existence for a period of approximately 50 years. Plaintiff constructed a residence on his land and installed a swimming pool and made expenditures for planting, seeding and landscaping. He also testified that he made intermittent use of the pond until approximately 1958 when defendant’s property was acquired for school purposes and upon which a school building and other facilities were subsequently installed. The school premises of the defendant lie a distance north of the pond and are substantially higher in el ovation than plaintiff’s land and the testimony shows that the elevation, if anything, has been reduced rather than increased by the installation of the school facilities and the adoption of the drainage plan. In improving the school site and the surrounding areas it is alleged that defendants caused the surface waters which would normally flow from the area to bo diverted from their natural course by the use of pipes, catch basins and other artificial channels thereby causing an excessive amount of water to flow into said pond, resulting in an overflow onto plaintiff’s land and causing damage to his property. In substance, defendant is an upland owner, and its property is separated from the area of the pond by intervening land owned by others. It is claimed, *341among other things, that the channeling of surface waters by artificial means off of defendant’s lands concentrates the flow of water, and thus raises the pond level to a point where the natural overflow gate and drainage channel in front of the dam or wall cannot absorb the waters thus caused to overflow. There is no contention here that waters other than those naturally flowing to the pond area prior to the construction of the school are now caused to enter the pond. Plaintiff’s theory seems to be that the concentrated collection of waters through the installation of catch basins and pipes causes water eventually to enter into the pond with greater force at a given time than otherwise would be the case; that defendant’s acts in channeling the waters prevent a more natural or slower flow into the pond by reducing the degree of natural absorption. It is defendant’s position that in laying out the school site engineers and qualified experts were requested to submit a drainage and site plan; the severity of the slope existing prior to plaintiff’s construction was reduced and that the net result of the plan finally adopted was to improve the drainage situation with respect to its land, the land of other owners and the pond, and not to interfere with or to damage surrounding properties. Our highest courts have determined the law in this State with respect to the rights of lower and upper owners to improve their lands, and recent cases have contained a full discussion of the rights of property owners in connection with this vexatious problem, to wit, the disposition and flow of surface waters. It is now established that our courts have adopted the so-called “ common law ” rule in order to avoid discrimination against a lower proprietor. Under the “ civil law ” as distinguished from the ‘ ‘ common law ’ ’ the upper owner was held to be the dominant estate and the lower property owner held to be the servient estate. Under the common law neither holds a dominant or servient estate or position with respect to the other. Both have equal rights to improve their property come what may to the surface water, provided the improvements are made in good faith to fit the property for some rational use to which it is adapted and that the water is not drained into the other’s property by artificial means, such as pipes and ditches.

On the 18th day of April, 1896, the relator was appointed to the position of teamster with team, in the employ of the park commission, from which position he was removed on the 30th of May, 1896, * 537without any hearing being had on notice to him upon charges made. He made this motion for a writ of mandamus, which was denied at the Special Term, and he now appeals from the order denying his motion. Where one moves upon notice of motion for a peremptory mandamus he is entitled to it only when there is no conflict of fact in the paper ' s presented to the court on the hearing, The Code provides that a peremptory writ of mandamus can be issued upon motion only where the applicant ’ s right depends upon questions of law. ( Code Civ. Proc. § 2070. ) In considering, therefore, whether the applicant here is entitled to a peremptory writ of mandamus, any averments contained in his papers which are denied in the opposing affidavits must be disregarded and the facts set out in those affidavits must be assumed to be true. ( In re Haebler v. New York Produce Exchange, 149 N. Y. 414 ; People ex rel. Thompson v. Brookfield, 6 App. Div. 398. ) It is not contradicted that the relator is a veteran. He says in his moving papers that at the time of his application for appointment he stated to one of the commissioners, to whom he made the application, that he was a veteran, and that fact is not denied. He further states in his moving affidavits, upon information and belief, that there is kept upon the records of the board of park commissioners a list of all the employees of the department of public works who are veterans, and that the fact that he was an honorably discharged sailor was known to the board of park commissioners of the city of Few York. This fact is stated solely upon information and belief, and the sources of the information and the grounds of belief are not stated, so that the allegation itself amounts to nothing as proof of the assertions which are said to be believed by the applicant. ( Buell v. Van Camp, 119 N. Y. 160, 165. ) Theró is no other proof in the moving ¡ capers from which it could be inferred that it was known to the park commissioners that this man was a veteran. The affidavit of the respondents alleges that it does not appear upon the records or from any information which had been furnished by the relator, that he was a veteran. So, in the decision of this case, it must be borne in mind that although the relator was a veteran, that fact had not been made to appear to the respondents so that it had been entered upon their records. At the • time O ’ Brien was appointed he was not within - the provisions of the Veteran Act, * 538and there was no reason why the fact that he was a veteran should have been made to appear, because the position which he had was not one which would have entitled him to a hearing before discharge. The act which entitled him to the privileges of a veteran only became a law nine days before his removal, and it is not at all likely, in view of the delay which always exists in publishing statutes, that ' anybody was aware of the existence of this act at the time wlien the - relator was discharged on the thirtieth of May, nine ' days after its. passage. But the respondents were bound by it, of course, whether they knew anything of it or not, and the only question is whether,, upon the facts which it appears were then known to them, it - was. their duty to have given to this man the privileges of a veteran td which lie would have been entitled if that fact had been made known to them -. It did not appear upon their records. "" There is no proof that any one of them had been informed of it except Commissioner McMillan, and there is no proof that he. was ever informed of it in such a way as to bring it to the notice of the board, or that they in fact did have notice of it. If they had no notice that this man was. a veteran, they were not in default for failing to give him the privileges of "" one until, at least, he had brought the fact. to their notice and demanded the hearing which the law entitled him to. The respondents say that no such demand was ever made upon them, and that statement in their opposing affidavit must be assumed to be true. The question is then presented whether it was the duty of ’ the relator to inform the park commissioners of his standing as a - veteran and of his right to a hearing and to demand such a hearing - before he would be entitled to a writ of mandamus to enforce that right. We are of the opinion that he was bound to make such a. demand, and that until he had made it and been refused, he was not entitled to a peremptory writ of mandamus ’ to restore him to the - position from which he had been removed. It is well settled that ; previous to the making of an application to the court for a writ of ' mandamus to compel the performance of an official act, a demand must be made by the applicant upon the officer - that he do the act ; which it is sought to compel him to perform, and the respondent must have refused to comply with the demand, either in distinct terms, or by conduct from which a refusal can be implied, because it is due to. the defendant to have the option of doing the act before an applica * 539tion shall be made to the court to compel him to do it. ( United States v. Boutwell, 17 Wall. 604 ; 14 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 106 ; High on Extr. Leg. Rem. § § 13, 41. ) While this is the general rule,. yet there is undoubtedly an exception to it in cases where the duty to be performed is public in its nature. In such a case, the duty being - public, it is not the business of any particular person to demand that it shall - be performed, and if the officer has neglected to perform it when he should, the writ may issue without any previous demand and refusal. This distinction is recognized by the text writers and the authorities, and it was the express ground upon which the writ was issued without a demand in the case of Commonwealth ex rel. Middleton v. Comrs. ( 37 Penn. St. 237 ), and Attorney - General v. City of Boston ( 123 Mass. 460 ). In each of these cases the fact that the duty of the defendant was a public duty was made the ; ground of the exception from the rule that a demand should be made - upon them to perform the duty before a writ of mandamus issued to - require it. The duty which is sought to be imposed upon the defendants here is not public at all. The writ is sought simply to protect a. private right, in the performance of which nobody but the relator has any interest. The case is, therefore, within the general rule ; cited above. But it is claimed that it is apparent from the papers that a demand and refusal would have been of no avail. There is not, however, one particle of evidence in the case from which that could have been inferred. At the time the relator was appointed, and until nine days before his removal, it was settled law that ' he did not hold a position by appointment, so as to entitle him to a hearing before ; his removal. ( Meyers v. Mayor, etc., 69 Hun, 291. ) There is an almost necessary presumption in this case, - not only that the commissioners did not know that the relator was a veteran, but that they were in truth ignorant of the law which gave him the privilege of a hearing, and that they supposed the law remained, as it undoubtedly had been down to nine days before, and that the removal of the ; relator without a hearing took place solely because they were ignorant of his rights. There is no suggestion in the papers, even upon, the information and belief of the applicant, that the respondents ; would not reconsider their action and give him a hearing if they were asked to do it. • * 540It is riot too much to say in such a case that the person insisting - upon a private right shall make application to a public officer to give him that which the law assures him he should have, and until he does make. such application he ought not to be permitted to ask the court ■ for its compulsory writ to give him the thing which, - for aught that. appears, he might have obtained by the asking. For th „ e reason that the relator did not make this demand, which ' it is still in his power to make, the order denying the writ was. proper and should be affirmed, with costs. Van Brunt, P.

5229863_1,1038,"Judgment and order unanimously affirmed, with costs, on the opinion of Mr. Justice Borst at Trial Term. The following is the opinion of Mr. Justice Borst : Borst, J. : I am of the opinion that the evidence in this case in connection with section 18 of the Labor Law, * which would seem to apply, was sufficient to make the defendant ’ s negligence a question for the jury. ( McConnell v. Morse Iron Works, 102 App. Div. 324 ; Cummings v. Kenny, 97 id. 114 ; Kelly v. National Starch Co., 142 id. 286. ) * 488The provision of the Labor Law referred to does not preclude the defendant, however, from invoking the contributory negligence, if any there was, of plaintiff ’ s intestate. ( Gombert v. McKay, 201 N. Y. 27. ) Now as to the contributory negligence of plaintiff ’ s intestate. The case was submitted to the jury on the theory that on this question plaintiff had the burden of proof and this must, therefore, undoubtedly be the law of the case on this motion. This burden, however, it would seem under the provisions of the Labor Law ( § 202a ) * as it now stands, was on the defendant. Treating the case, therefore, on the theory on which it was tried, I think the intestate ’ s negligence was a jury question. The jury were authorized to find that the spurs on the foot of ladders used about defendant ’ s premises became dull by usage and were sharpened from time to time ; that this was no part of the duties of the intestate. This was a duty, however, imposed by law upon the defendant and especially so by virtue of the section of the Labor Law cited. The spurs on the ladder in question were dull and the jury had the right to find from the evidence that had they not been so they would have sunk into the floor under the weight of plaintiff ’ s intestate and not have slipped and the accident would thereby not have occurred. Evidence was given by one of defendant ’ s employees to the effect that some weeks prior to the day of the accident ladders, including the ladder in question, had been used by plaintiff ’ s intestate and the witness ; that the witness had forced the spurs into the floor in the intestate ’ s presence by hitting - them with a hammer. The truthfulness and force of this evidence was for the jury. Plaintiff ’ s intestate might well have assumed that the spurs on the ladder in question had been sharpened between the time that witness referred to and the day of the accident when he came to use it. It does not appear that plaintiff ’ s intestate knew that the spurs on the ladder were dull. The direction to the intestate to perform the work in which he was engaged came from his foreman, who testifies : “ I went in the powerhouse. Shovan was there. I said to * 489him, ' Middy, when you have time, or when you haven ’ t got much to do, take and connect up the radiator that is in the toilet room off of the assembly room with a 2 % inch pipe that we recently ran down through there from the heating coil in the northwest corner of the building. There is no particular hurry about it, but do it when you have time to do it. Your pipe is here on the floor. ’ The pipe was lying on the floor right beside him when I was speaking. The ladder stands up by the heating coil in the northwest end of the building. ” The ladder was in place and the intestate was to go up that and make the connection. He had a pail of paint in his hand which was to be used on the joints of the pipes which he was to connect. He was near the top of the ladder when it slipped and the fall came which resulted in his death. In view of the attention which he must necessarily have given to his work, the materials he was to take and use, and in view of the instructions given to him by the foreman to go up that ladder to do the work, it was at least for the jury to say whether he should have in mind, distracted as his attention might have been, that the defendant had failed to sharpen the spurs on the ladder.

Added by Laws of 1910, chap. 352. — [ Rep.",5229863," Judgment and order unanimously affirmed, with costs, on the opinion of Mr. Justice Borst at Trial Term. The following is the opinion of Mr. Justice Borst: Borst, J.: I am of the opinion that the evidence in this case in connection with section 18 of the Labor Law,* which would seem to apply, was sufficient to make the defendant’s negligence a question for the jury. (McConnell v. Morse Iron Works, 102 App. Div. 324; Cummings v. Kenny, 97 id. 114; Kelly v. National Starch Co., 142 id. 286.) *488The provision of the Labor Law referred to does not preclude the defendant, however, from invoking the contributory negligence, if any there was, of plaintiff’s intestate. (Gombert v. McKay, 201 N. Y. 27.) Now as to the contributory negligence of plaintiff’s intestate. The case was submitted to the jury on the theory that on this question plaintiff had the burden of proof and this must, therefore, undoubtedly be the law of the case on this motion. This burden, however, it would seem under the provisions of the Labor Law (§ 202a)* as it now stands, was on the defendant. Treating the case, therefore, on the theory on which it was tried, I think the intestate’s negligence was a jury question. The jury were authorized to find that the spurs on the foot of ladders used about defendant’s premises became dull by usage and were sharpened from time to time; that this was no part of the duties of the intestate. This was a duty, however, imposed by law upon the defendant and especially so by virtue of the section of the Labor Law cited. The spurs on the ladder in question were dull and the jury had the right to find from the evidence that had they not been so they would have sunk into the floor under the weight of plaintiff’s intestate and not have slipped and the accident would thereby not have occurred. Evidence was given by one of defendant’s employees to the effect that some weeks prior to the day of the accident ladders, including the ladder in question, had been used by plaintiff’s intestate and the witness; that the witness had forced the spurs into the floor in the intestate’s presence by hitting-them with a hammer. The truthfulness and force of this evidence was for the jury. Plaintiff’s intestate might well have assumed that the spurs on the ladder in question had been sharpened between the time that witness referred to and the day of the accident when he came to use it. It does not appear that plaintiff’s intestate knew that the spurs on the ladder were dull. The direction to the intestate to perform the work in which he was engaged came from his foreman, who testifies: “I went in the powerhouse. Shovan was there. I said to *489him, 'Middy, when you have time, or when you haven’t got much to do, take and connect up the radiator that is in the toilet room off of the assembly room with a 2% inch pipe that we recently ran down through there from the heating coil in the northwest corner of the building. There is no particular hurry about it, but do it when you have time to do it. Your pipe is here on the floor.’ The pipe was lying on the floor right beside him when I was speaking. The ladder stands up by the heating coil in the northwest end of the building.” The ladder was in place and the intestate was to go up that and make the connection. He had a pail of paint in his hand which was to be used on the joints of the pipes which he was to connect. He was near the top of the ladder when it slipped and the fall came which resulted in his death. In view of the attention which he must necessarily have given to his work, the materials he was to take and use, and in view of the instructions given to him by the foreman to go up that ladder to do the work, it was at least for the jury to say whether he should have in mind, distracted as his attention might have been, that the defendant had failed to sharpen the spurs on the ladder. (Kettle v. Turl, 162 N. Y. 255; Delaney v. City of Mount Vernon, 89 App. Div. 209.) The motions for a nonsuit and the new trial should, therefore, be denied. See Consol.

Paul by the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York on March 6, 1922, which policy is on the twenty - year payment life plan ; that the annual premium on said policy is $ 257. 20, which have been kept paid in order to keep the policy in force pending a final determination of the guardian ' s rights and duties in respect to said policy. It is further averred that defendant, Kathleen Jones, is named beneficiary in said policy ; but that the right is reserved to the insured, under the terms of the policy, of revocation and change of beneficiary. That the guardian believes that since the right of revocation and change * Page 80 of beneficiary is reserved in the policy, no rights whatever vested in the beneficiary any present interest and that the cash surrender of said policy is that of the insured in her own right ; that even if the court should declare he has no right to surrender the policy for cash as a part of his ward ' s estate, yet he has the right to discontinue payment of premiums and allow the policy to remain in a paid - up status according to the non - forfeiture clause of the policy. It is further alleged that in all of these insistences the beneficiary, Kathleen Jones, has an adverse interest and is made a party defendant in order that she may have the opportunity to present what claim, if any, she may have in connection with said policy. The prayer of the bill is, in substance, that the court advise and direct the guardian with reference to the matters set out in the bill. Defendant, Kathleen Jones, made answer and alleged that to maintain the insurance in force would be more beneficial to the estate of Nannie J. Paul than would be the cash for which the policy could be surrendered ; that complainant did not allege facts showing that a conversion of the policy into cash would be of any benefit to her estate ; and that Nannie J. Paul having created a succession during her sanity by which Kathleen Jones was to succeed to the value of the insurance policy upon her death, the court should protect and carry out the intentions and desires of the incompetent as shown by her acts prior to her incompetency ; that should the court find it was to the best interest of the estate of the incompetent to convert the policy into cash such conversion shall be under the direction of the court, so that the fund so created would, upon the death of the incompetent, prior to the death of Kathleen Jones, be payable to said * Page 81 defendant as would be the proceeds of the insurance policy if left in force ; and that if the court should find it to the best interests of the incompetent ' s estate to direct the surrender of the policy for either a term insurance policy or a paid - up policy that it should be payable under the same terms as the existing policy. It is further alleged that there was available dividend additions having a cash value of $ 575, which could be cashed without surrendering the policy, in the event the income from the estate of the incompetent should be insufficient to keep her in comfort and pay the annual premiums upon the policy, it would be more advantageous to her estate and would maintain the succession to the benefits ; that she ( Kathleen Jones ) has an expectant interest in said policy which should be protected and preserved by the court. The cause was tried upon a written stipulation of facts. The decree of the chancellor, in its material parts, was as follows : "" 1. That the amount of premiums which the Guardian has paid since Insured ' s commitment in order to keep the policy in force, together with all costs of this cause, including the fee, hereinafter allowed, of the guardian ad litem, shall be paid by the guardian out of the cash surrender value of the dividend additions upon said policy. "" 2. That the policy involved in this cause shall not be surrendered for cash at this time, but it shall be retained and kept in force in the manner hereinafter decreed. "" 3. That after the guardian has repaid to himself, for the benefit of the estate of Nannie J. Paul, the amount of the premium payments which he has paid from her estate since his appointment, and after the costs of this cause have been paid out of the cash surrender value of * Page 82 the dividend additions, as ordered by Paragraph 1, supra, the balance of the cash surrender value of said dividend additions upon the policy shall be applied by the Guardian to the payment of future premiums as they shall fall due. When the cash surrender value of the dividend additions and those dividends which may be declared upon the policy annually, have been exhausted so that the premiums cannot be paid from that source, then the Guardian shall advance from the estate of Nannie J. Paul such further sums as may be necessary to pay the premiums and keep the policy in force until it shall become a paid up policy under its terms. Such sums as may be advanced from the estate of Nannie J. Paul for the payment of future premiums shall be and remain a prior charge against said policy or proceeds realized therefrom, in favor of the estate of Nannie J. Paul, to the amount of such advancements, together with 6 % interest from the date of such payment or payments by the Guardian. Any dividends declared by the insurance company upon the policy after the premiums have been fully paid, shall be collected by the Guardian and credited by him as repayments to the estate of Nannie J. Paul, of the advancements made from her estate in paying the premiums upon the policy. In the event the dividends declared upon the policy shall be insufficient to reimburse the estate of Nannie J. Paul for the amount of the advancements with interest thereon at the time the policy becomes collectible, then the proceeds of the policy shall be first subject to the payment of the balance of such advancements. "" 4. That the complainant guardian be, and he hereby is, authorized and instructed to do all acts and to make such applications, complete such forms, sign such lien * Page 83 instruments or do any other acts as may be necessary to effect the plan as hereinabove outlined and decreed. "" 5. That the fee of the Guardian ad litem, Clarence Kolwyck, is fixed at $ 50. 00 for services to date. "" 6. That this decree is without prejudice to the Guardian in making further application to be allowed to surrender said policy for cash in the event of extraordinary need on the part of the Ward, and is without prejudice to the rights of the Insured Ward under the policy contract, and the cause shall be and remain open for any petitions or orders that may be necessary in this respect. "" From this decree all of the parties, except defendant insurance company, have appealed to this court and assigned errors. The controlling questions presented for determination may be stated as follows : ( 1 ) Shall the policy be surrendered for its cash value? ( 2 ) If not, how shall the premiums be paid? An insane person is, of course, incapable of exercising a right or power of election, but any election on his behalf should be exercised by the court. 32 C. J., 749. But, to authorize such election it shall clearly appear to be for the best interests of the incompetent. 32 C. J., 695. It appears from the stipulation of facts that the assets of the estate of Nannie J. Paul aggregate approximately $ 27, 680 and consist of U. S. Government bonds and other liquid assets, except approximately $ 10, 650 in notes due her, most of which are secured by land either in Alabama or Georgia. The guardian ' s annual settlement for the year ending February 10, 1939, discloses a gross income from the estate, including considerable delinquent interest collected on said notes, of $ 1, 302. 20, and that disbursements amounted to $ 1, 202. 85, * Page 84 including several hundred dollars for non - recurring items. The guardian estimates an income from the estate for the current year at about $ 850, and that the disbursements will be within the income, barring any protracted sickness or other emergency. In the absence of such emergencies, payments of $ 100 quarterly to the Central State Hospital provide for all the comforts and care of Nannie J. Paul that can be supplied one in her condition. Clothes are not included in this figure. The premiums upon the guardian ' s bond are $ 150 annually and further expenses on account of administration costs are to be anticipated. It appears from the application for the policy that Nannie J. Paul was born September 14, 1877. She is now slightly over 62 years of age. With a sufficient income from her estate to take care of her adequately in the hospital where she is confined, no sufficient reason is shown why the court should exercise the power of election in her behalf to surrender the policy for its present cash value of $ 3, 451. 41. Furthermore, the chancellor in his decree expressly reserved to the guardian the right to make further application to be allowed to surrender the policy for cash in the event of extraordinary need on the part of the ward and provided that the cause shall be and remain open for any petitions or orders that may be necessary in this respect. While it is true that the beneficiary, Kathleen Jones, a grandniece of the insured, has no vested interest in the insurance prior to the death of the insured, the right to change the beneficiary being reserved in the policy, Life Association v. Winn, 96 Tenn. 224, 33 S. W. 1045 ; Lunsford v. Nashville Sav. Corp., 162 Tenn. 179, 35 S. W. 2d 395, nevertheless, the court will not elect to order a surrender of the policy for its cash value and * Page 85 thereby destroy the beneficiary ' s contingent interest, save and unless it be plainly shown to be for the manifest interest of the insane insured. While it cannot be said that the beneficiary has the legal right of succession to the benefits of the policy, during the lifetime of the insured, yet, the insured while sane, named Kathleen Jones as the person she desired the proceeds of the policy to be paid. While, as above stated, the beneficiary is without legal right to succession during the lifetime of the insured, the rule against alteration in succession by a court can be said to find application in a general way to a situation presented in the instant case. In 32 C. J., 724, the rule is stated as follows : "" Before the character of the interest in property, held by a person of unsound mind, can be changed, it must be made manifest that it is necessary to protect and promote his interest. Although as a rule, the court will preserve, so far as possible, the interests of the succession, this rule yields to the paramount rule which makes the ward ' s welfare the first consideration without regard to the rights of those who may have eventually rights to succession. "" In note 78 to the above, it appears that in Matter of Colah, 3 Daly, N. Y., 529, 538, the court quoted the following from the English case of Ex parte Whitbread, 35 Reprint 878 : "" The Court has nothing to consider but the situation of the lunatic himself, always looking to the probability of his recovery, and never regarding the interest of the next of kin. . . . The Court does nothing wantonly or unnecessarily to alter the lunatic ' s property, but, on the contrary, takes care of it for his sake, that, if he recover, he shall find his estate as nearly as possible in the same condition as he left it, applying the property * Page 86 in the mean time, as the Court thinks it would have been wise and prudent in the lunatic himself to apply it, if he had been capable. "" On the second question presented, how the premiums shall be paid, we think the method set forth in the chancellor ' s decree to be just and equitable and for the best interest of the ward. Without further elaboration, it is our conclusion that all assignments of error must be overruled and the decree of the chancellor affirmed. The cause will be remanded for such further proceedings as may become necessary. The costs of the cause will be paid by the complainant guardian out of the assets of the estate of the ward. * Page 87",3891954,"Complainant, Aubrey F. Folts, as guardian of Nannie J.

6434115_1,2143,"Loring, J. The defendant operates a private hospital for gain. The plaintiff went there to undergo an operation. She testified that "" her physician made the arrangements for [ Tier ] entering into the hospital. . . . That she paid to the hospital $ 15 a week for attendance and $ 10 for the use of the operating room. ” The operation was performed by a surgeon not connected with the defendant hospital. The plaintiff was etherized by her family physician and he was not connected with the defendant. In addition to the surgeon and the family physician two of the defendant ’ s nurses were present at the operation. When the plaintiff was on the operating table before she went under ether she had two rings on her hands. After the operation and while the plaintiff was still under the effects of ether she was carried from the operating room to her own room in the hospital by “ one of the doctors assisted by the nurses. ” When the plaintiff came out of the ether she noticed that the more valuable of the two rings ( a ring which “ would not come off without assistance ” ) was missing. At the trial the plaintiff put the surgeon and the family physician on the witness stand. Each of them testified that he did not take the ring. The defendant put on the stand the superintendent of the hospital, one of the two operating nurses and the plaintiff ’ s day nurse. Each of them testified that she did not take the ring. The operating nurse who was put upon the witness stand testified that the other operating nurse was in California “ the last time she heard from ” her. The plaintiff made many requests for rulings and now insists upon the first, fifth, eleventh and twelfth set forth above. These were refused and an exception taken. The judge instructed the jury that to recover the plaintiff must prove that she was in the exercise of due care and that the defendant was negligent. An exception was taken to this ruling. The case is here on these exceptions. * 136On the evidence the jury were warranted in finding that the ring was forcibly removed from the plaintiff ’ s hand by the operating nurse who when last heard from was in California. If the absent nurse did steal the ring it is plain that the defendant is not liable on the ground that in stealing the ring the nurse was acting within the scope of her employment as a servant of the defendant. The first request for ruling therefore was properly refused. If the plaintiff had stood in the relation of a stranger to the defendant there would have been no error in the. trial. But the plaintiff did not stand to the defendant in the relation of a stranger. It is apparent from, the bill of exceptions that the case was not tried on the footing that the rights of the plaintiff in this action depended upon the contract made by her with the defendant. For this reason the terms of this contract do not appear as fully as they otherwise would have done. But from what does appear in the bill of exceptions the presiding judge was wrong in telling the jury that the defendant ’ s liability depended upon the plaintiff proving that it was negligent. . Under the contract entered into by the defendant corporation it was its duty not only ( 1 ) to give the plaintiff a room in the hospital before and after the operation and ( 2 ) to give her surgeon and family physician the use of the operating room for the operatian, but also ( 3 ) to give to the plaintiff the services of such nurses as were necessary for her care before, after and during the operatian. It expressly appeared at the trial that “ she [ the plaintiff ] paid to the hospital $ 15 a week for attendance. ” The services of the nurses which under the contract the defendant was bound to furnish the plaintiff included the services of nurses while she was unconscious from the effects of the ether, a condition which was a necessary part of the operation. And the question we have to decide is whether there was a violation of duty on the part of the defendant under this contract if the operating nurse in question stole the ring by forcibly pulling it off the plaintiff ’ s finger while she was under the effects of ether, or whether on the facts appearing at the trial the jury could have so found. We are of opinion that the jury could have so found. If for example a stranger had burst into the operating room, attacked the plaintiff and done her bodily harm or had attacked * 137the plaintiff while the nurses were carrying her from the operating room to her own room and the defendant ’ s nurses had stood by and done nothing to protect the plaintiff from those attacks, it is plain in our opinion that there would have been a violation of the duty owed by the defendant under its contract with the plaintiff. It is equally plain in our opinion that the duty owed by the defendant under its contract with the plaintiff extended to the care of the rings on her fingers while she was unconscious from the effects of ether as well as to the security of her person. And finally it is equally plain in our opinion that there is as much a violation of the duty owed by the defendant under the contract where the attack upon the person or larceny of the ring is committed by one of the defendant ’ s own nurses ( whose duty it was to protect the plaintiff ) as well as in the case where the attack is made by a stranger and the nurses do not undertake to protect her from the attack. In its legal aspects the case is governed by the decision in Bryant v. Rich, 106 Mass. 180. In that case a dispute arose between a passenger on one of the defendant ’ s steamers and one of the defendant ’ s waiters as to whether the passenger had paid for his supper. The plaintiff, a cousin of the passenger in question, made a suggestion to which no exception could have been taken. Whereupon not only the waiter in question but the head steward and the other waiters knocked down the plaintiff and beat him. It was for this assault and battery that the action in Bryant v. Rich was brought. The presiding judge ruled ( in accordance with a request made by the defendant ) that “ there is no evidence that the steward and waiters, in assaulting the plaintiff, were acting within the scope of any authority, or in the discharge of any duty, imposed upon them by the defendants. ” But in spite of this he instructed the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. This ruling was sustained on the ground that as matter of contract the plaintiff as a passenger had the right to receive proper treatment from the defendants and their servants and all of them. This decision has been followed in other cases - of carriers of passengers. Hayne v. Union Street Railway, 189 Mass. 551. Jackson v. Old Colony Street Railway, 206 Mass. 477. Gentile v. Boston Elevated Railway, 217 Mass. 113. In Levins v. New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad, 183 Mass. 175, it was held that a case was * 138not made out under this rule where a purse had been accidentally - left on the window sill of the wash room of a car of the defendant company. In Fairbanks v. Boston Storage Warehouse Co. 189 Mass. 419, it was held that it did not apply where an assault was made by an attendant who under the rules of the defendant company accompanied the plaintiff when he went to examine goods stored by him in the warehouse of the defendant. The reason why the rule of Bryant v. Rich did not apply in the case of Fairbanks v. Boston Storage Warehouse Co. was because of the fact that the employee who made the assault was in attendance upon the plaintiff at the time in question for the plaintiff ’ s own purposes. He was not a servant of the defendant to whose services the plaintiff was entitled under his contract with the defendant. The decision in Bryant v. Rich does not depend upon the fact that the defendants in that case were common carriers. The decision would have been the same had the assault and battery occurred on an excursion steamer in place of upon a steamer operated by a common carrier. And the decision would have been the same if the steward and waiters had stolen rings from Bryant ’ s fingers in place of knocking him down as they did. The doctrine of Bryant v. Rich applies whenever there is a contract between the plaintiff and defendant by force of which the defendant is to furnish for the plaintiff ’ s comfort the services of its, the defendant ’ s, employees. Where the injury to the plaintiff is caused by an act of the defendant ’ s servants done in the course of their employment an action may be brought based on negligence of the defendant ’ s servants for which the defendant is liable because the act took place in the course of his servants ’ employment, or an action may be brought in that case based on violation of the duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff under the contract between the defendant and the plaintiff. But where ( as was the case in Bryant v. Rich and in the case at bar ) the injury done the plaintiff is caused by an act of the defendant ’ s servants outside of the servants ’ duty as employees of the defendant but by an act of the defendant ’ s servants which while not in the course of the servants ’ employment is none the less a violation of the duty owed by the defendant under the defendant ’ s contract with the plaintiff, the only action that can be brought is an action founded upon the duty arising out of the contract. * 139The second count sufficiently sets forth a liability on the part of the defendant for violation of its duty under its contract with the plaintiff. It was held in Bryant v. Rich that “ for a violation of such a contract either by force or negligence, the plaintiff may bring an action of tort, or an action of contract. ” What has been said leaves open the defence which arises out of the testimony that the plaintiff when received into the hospital was asked to put into the custody of the defendant corporation all her “ valuables. ” The defendant ’ s agent who received the plaintiff when she came to. the hospital testified that that request was made to her at that time. The plaintiff on the other hand testified that she was asked to put her money into the custody of the hospital but that she was not asked to put anything else into its custody. If the defendant ’ s evidence is believed, a defence is made out. On the other hand if the plaintiff ’ s evidence on this matter is believed, her rights depend upon the rule of Bryant v. Rich, ubi supra. Exceptions sustained.",6434115," Loring, J. The defendant operates a private hospital for gain. The plaintiff went there to undergo an operation. She testified that ""her physician made the arrangements for [Tier] entering into the hospital. . . . That she paid to the hospital $15 a week for attendance and $10 for the use of the operating room.” The operation was performed by a surgeon not connected with the defendant hospital. The plaintiff was etherized by her family physician and he was not connected with the defendant. In addition to the surgeon and the family physician two of the defendant’s nurses were present at the operation. When the plaintiff was on the operating table before she went under ether she had two rings on her hands. After the operation and while the plaintiff was still under the effects of ether she was carried from the operating room to her own room in the hospital by “one of the doctors assisted by the nurses.” When the plaintiff came out of the ether she noticed that the more valuable of the two rings (a ring which “would not come off without assistance”) was missing. At the trial the plaintiff put the surgeon and the family physician on the witness stand. Each of them testified that he did not take the ring. The defendant put on the stand the superintendent of the hospital, one of the two operating nurses and the plaintiff’s day nurse. Each of them testified that she did not take the ring. The operating nurse who was put upon the witness stand testified that the other operating nurse was in California “the last time she heard from” her. The plaintiff made many requests for rulings and now insists upon the first, fifth, eleventh and twelfth set forth above. These were refused and an exception taken. The judge instructed the jury that to recover the plaintiff must prove that she was in the exercise of due care and that the defendant was negligent. An exception was taken to this ruling. The case is here on these exceptions. *136On the evidence the jury were warranted in finding that the ring was forcibly removed from the plaintiff’s hand by the operating nurse who when last heard from was in California. If the absent nurse did steal the ring it is plain that the defendant is not liable on the ground that in stealing the ring the nurse was acting within the scope of her employment as a servant of the defendant. The first request for ruling therefore was properly refused. If the plaintiff had stood in the relation of a stranger to the defendant there would have been no error in the. trial. But the plaintiff did not stand to the defendant in the relation of a stranger. It is apparent from, the bill of exceptions that the case was not tried on the footing that the rights of the plaintiff in this action depended upon the contract made by her with the defendant. For this reason the terms of this contract do not appear as fully as they otherwise would have done. But from what does appear in the bill of exceptions the presiding judge was wrong in telling the jury that the defendant’s liability depended upon the plaintiff proving that it was negligent. .Under the contract entered into by the defendant corporation it was its duty not only (1) to give the plaintiff a room in the hospital before and after the operation and (2) to give her surgeon and family physician the use of the operating room for the operatian, but also (3) to give to the plaintiff the services of such nurses as were necessary for her care before, after and during the operatian. It expressly appeared at the trial that “she [the plaintiff] paid to the hospital $15 a week for attendance.” The services of the nurses which under the contract the defendant was bound to furnish the plaintiff included the services of nurses while she was unconscious from the effects of the ether, a condition which was a necessary part of the operation. And the question we have to decide is whether there was a violation of duty on the part of the defendant under this contract if the operating nurse in question stole the ring by forcibly pulling it off the plaintiff’s finger while she was under the effects of ether, or whether on the facts appearing at the trial the jury could have so found. We are of opinion that the jury could have so found. If for example a stranger had burst into the operating room, attacked the plaintiff and done her bodily harm or had attacked *137the plaintiff while the nurses were carrying her from the operating room to her own room and the defendant’s nurses had stood by and done nothing to protect the plaintiff from those attacks, it is plain in our opinion that there would have been a violation of the duty owed by the defendant under its contract with the plaintiff. It is equally plain in our opinion that the duty owed by the defendant under its contract with the plaintiff extended to the care of the rings on her fingers while she was unconscious from the effects of ether as well as to the security of her person. And finally it is equally plain in our opinion that there is as much a violation of the duty owed by the defendant under the contract where the attack upon the person or larceny of the ring is committed by one of the defendant’s own nurses (whose duty it was to protect the plaintiff) as well as in the case where the attack is made by a stranger and the nurses do not undertake to protect her from the attack. In its legal aspects the case is governed by the decision in Bryant v. Rich, 106 Mass. 180. In that case a dispute arose between a passenger on one of the defendant’s steamers and one of the defendant’s waiters as to whether the passenger had paid for his supper. The plaintiff, a cousin of the passenger in question, made a suggestion to which no exception could have been taken. Whereupon not only the waiter in question but the head steward and the other waiters knocked down the plaintiff and beat him. It was for this assault and battery that the action in Bryant v. Rich was brought. The presiding judge ruled (in accordance with a request made by the defendant) that “there is no evidence that the steward and waiters, in assaulting the plaintiff, were acting within the scope of any authority, or in the discharge of any duty, imposed upon them by the defendants.” But in spite of this he instructed the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. This ruling was sustained on the ground that as matter of contract the plaintiff as a passenger had the right to receive proper treatment from the defendants and their servants and all of them. This decision has been followed in other cases- of carriers of passengers. Hayne v. Union Street Railway, 189 Mass. 551. Jackson v. Old Colony Street Railway, 206 Mass. 477. Gentile v. Boston Elevated Railway, 217 Mass. 113. In Levins v. New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad, 183 Mass. 175, it was held that a case was *138not made out under this rule where a purse had been accidentally-left on the window sill of the wash room of a car of the defendant company. In Fairbanks v. Boston Storage Warehouse Co. 189 Mass. 419, it was held that it did not apply where an assault was made by an attendant who under the rules of the defendant company accompanied the plaintiff when he went to examine goods stored by him in the warehouse of the defendant. The reason why the rule of Bryant v. Rich did not apply in the case of Fairbanks v. Boston Storage Warehouse Co. was because of the fact that the employee who made the assault was in attendance upon the plaintiff at the time in question for the plaintiff’s own purposes. He was not a servant of the defendant to whose services the plaintiff was entitled under his contract with the defendant. The decision in Bryant v. Rich does not depend upon the fact that the defendants in that case were common carriers. The decision would have been the same had the assault and battery occurred on an excursion steamer in place of upon a steamer operated by a common carrier. And the decision would have been the same if the steward and waiters had stolen rings from Bryant’s fingers in place of knocking him down as they did. The doctrine of Bryant v. Rich applies whenever there is a contract between the plaintiff and defendant by force of which the defendant is to furnish for the plaintiff’s comfort the services of its, the defendant’s, employees. Where the injury to the plaintiff is caused by an act of the defendant’s servants done in the course of their employment an action may be brought based on negligence of the defendant’s servants for which the defendant is liable because the act took place in the course of his servants’ employment, or an action may be brought in that case based on violation of the duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff under the contract between the defendant and the plaintiff. But where (as was the case in Bryant v. Rich and in the case at bar) the injury done the plaintiff is caused by an act of the defendant’s servants outside of the servants’ duty as employees of the defendant but by an act of the defendant’s servants which while not in the course of the servants’ employment is none the less a violation of the duty owed by the defendant under the defendant’s contract with the plaintiff, the only action that can be brought is an action founded upon the duty arising out of the contract. *139The second count sufficiently sets forth a liability on the part of the defendant for violation of its duty under its contract with the plaintiff. It was held in Bryant v. Rich that “for a violation of such a contract either by force or negligence, the plaintiff may bring an action of tort, or an action of contract.” What has been said leaves open the defence which arises out of the testimony that the plaintiff when received into the hospital was asked to put into the custody of the defendant corporation all her “valuables.” The defendant’s agent who received the plaintiff when she came to. the hospital testified that that request was made to her at that time. The plaintiff on the other hand testified that she was asked to put her money into the custody of the hospital but that she was not asked to put anything else into its custody.

5143016_1,2625,"Lawrence, J. Defendant in error lias filed motion in this court for an order dismissing the writ of error herein, on the ground that all the defendants below, and against whom the judgment was rendered, have not been made parties to the writ. The record shows that defendant in error brought an action of ejectment against Allen Wright and O. D. Argo to recover the possession of a lot, with house thereon, in the now city of South McAloster, and for damages for use and occupation by defendants. Said defendants Wright and Argo answered the complaint, denying the plaintiff ' s right of ownership, possession, and to recover damages. Thereafter the plaintiff in error Lewis, moved the court for an order making him a party defendant, upon the ground that he had purchased, for a good and valuable consideration, all the interest of said Wright in the premises in controversy. The order was granted, and Lewis filed his answer. Cause was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for defendant in error and for $ 425 damages. July 13, 1905, judgment was rendered on this verdict against all of said defendants, Allen Wright, O. D. Argo, and Yancey Lewis, for the possession of the real estate described in the complaint, and for the sum of $ 425 damages, and the costs of suit, and that all the necessary process to issue. Thereupon defendants prayed an appeal, which was granted, and 60 days given to file bill of exceptions, and the supersedeas bond - fixed at $ 2, 000. July! l2, 1905, there was filed in the United States District Court the petition of defendants Allen Wright and Yancey Lewis only for a writ of error, and it was thereupon allowed by William H. H. Clayton, judge of that court. Thereupon said defendants, Wright and Lewis, filed their assignment of errors. At same time, the said Wright and Lewis filed therein their supersedeas bond in the sum of $ 2, 000, which was allowed by said William H. H. Clayton, judge. There issued a writ of error, directed to said judge, which recited “ the rendition of the judgment of a plea which is in the United States Court before you, at the * 604Maj1 - term, 1905, thereof, between Ed. D. Sittle, plaintiff, and Allen Wright, O. W. Argo, and Yancey Lewis, defendants, a manifest error hath happened, to the great damage of said Yancey Lewis, as by their complaint appears. ” Said writ being duly allowed by said judge, the citation issued in pursuance thereof directed to this defendant in error, admonishing him to appear, “ pursuant to a writ of error * * * wherein Yancey Lewis is plaintiff in error and you are defendant in error. ” The transcript of record was filed in this court November 1, 1905. The question is whether or not the foregoing statement of the record justifies the court in sustaining the motion to dismiss the writ of error. It involves the consideration of the law regulating the practice relating to a writ of error. Prior to March 1, 1905, the act of Congress creating this court ( approved March - 1, 1895 ) provided that it should have such general superintendency and control over the courts of the Indian Territory as is conferred on the Supreme Court of Arkansas over the courts thereof by the laws of said state, as provided by chapter 40 of Mansfield ’ s Digest. This act was repealed by act of Congress approved March 3, 1905 ( chapter 1479, § 12, 33 Stat. 1081 [ U. S. Comp. St. Supp. 1905, p. 150 ] ), which provides that "" all appeals and writs of error shall be taken from United States Courts in the Indian Territory to the United States Court of Appeals of the Indian Territory in same manner as provided for taking appeals and writs of error from United states Circuit Courts to United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. ” Act Cong. March 3, 1891, c. 517, § 11, 26 Stat. 829, 1 Supp. Rev. St. ( 2d Ed. ) p. 904 [ U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 552 ], creating the Circuit Court of Appeals, provides ' that all writs of error must be sued out within six months of, entry of judgment to be reviewed. And all provisions of law now in force regulating the methods and system of review through appeals and writs of error shall regulate * 605same in Circuit Court of Appeals. Such rules and regulations - appear in section 997, Rev. St. U. S. ( 2d Ed. ) 1878 [ U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 712 ] : “ There shall be annexed to and returned with any writ of error for removal of a cause, at the dill ' - and place therein mentioned, an authenticated transcript of the record, an assignment of errors, and prayer for reversal, with a citation to the adverse party, * * * and the adverse party shall have at least twenty days ' notice. ” The foregoing constitute all of the statutory provisions relating to the writ of error in this case. They were in full force and effect when it was sued out. Proceedings thereunder are in the main as they are at common law, under which it is considered as a new action, and as such all the parties must be brought into the court by regular proceedings, with all the particularity of the original proceeding in the trial court. The Arkansas statute, adopted in this jurisdiction by act of Congress, provides : “ If there be several persons against whom any judgment may have been rendered, and who are entitled to bring writ of error or appeal thereon, living at the time of bringing the same, they shall all join therein, except where it may be ótherwise provided by law ; and if any are omitted the appeal shall be dismissed, on motion of appellee, upon due proof of the facts, unless one or more of such persons be allowed to proceed. ” Section 782, Carter ' s Ind. Ter. Ann. St. 1899. There is a further provision that, where it is shown by affidavit that the nonjoinder of the necessary parties is because of the incapability of their giving consent by reason of imbecility of mind, insanity, or absence from the state, the plaintiff in error may be allowed to prosecute the writ without - the joinder of such parties. The plaintiffs in error, in their verified reply to the motion to dismiss the writ of error, doubtless had this statute in view when they stated the reason for not joining therein Argo, defendant below, was because of his absence from this jurisdiction at the time of the trial, rendition of the judgment * 606and the filing of the petition for writ of error, ' and his residence at all such dates being unknown to plaintiffs in error, whereby his consent to such joinder could not be had. In said reply thejr conclude with prayer that the record be so amended as to now let in said Argo as a joint plaintiff in error with them. This statute. had been, by implication, repealed by the act of March 3, 1905, as above set forth, and had no application to the case at bar, for the record shows that this writ of error had been sued out subsequent to the passage of said act. And the writ, in contemplation of law, was sued out when filed in the office of the clerk of the trial court ( July 22, 1905 ). It was decided in Brooks vs Norris, 11 How. ( U. S. ) 204, 13 L. Ed. 665, that “ the writ of error is not brought, in the legal meaning of the term, until it is filed in the court. It is the filing of the writ that removes the record from the inferior to the Appellate Court. ” And the same court, in Credit Co. vs Ark. Central Ry., 128 U. S. 258, 9 Sup. Ct. 107, 32 L. Ed. 448, say : “ This decision has always been adhered to. ” Says Chief Justice Fuller : “ The distinction between writ of error and appeal has always been observed by this court, and has been recognized by the legislation of Congress from the foundation of the government, ” — in Elliott vs Toeppner, 187 U. S. 327, 23 Sup. Ct. 133, 47 L. Ed. 200, citing Dower vs Richards, 151 U. S. 663, 14 Sup. Ct. 452, 38 L. Ed. 305 ; Wiscart vs Dauchy, 3 Dall. ( Pa. ) 321, 1 L. Ed. 619, in which last - named case Ellsworth, C. J., speaking for the majority of the court, says : “ The judicial statute speaks of appeal and writ of error, but it does not confound the terms or use them promiscuously. They are to be understood, when used, aceording ' to their ordinary acceptation, unless something appears in the act itself to control, modify, or change the fixed technical sense which they have previously borne. An appeal is a process of civil law origin, and removes a cause entirely, subjecting the fact, as well as the law, to a review and retrial, but a writ of error is a process of common - law origin, * 607and it removes nothing for examination but the law. Does the statute observe these obvious distinctions? I think it does. ' ' The common law treats the writ of error as a new action, and not as the continuation of one already commenced, as we have observed. 2 Tidd ' s Practice, 1141 ; 7 Ency. Pl. & Pr. 822 - 860 ; Bank vs Jenkins, 104 111. 143 ; Bank vs Kerby, 9 Ark. 347 ; Miller vs Hoard, 6 Ark. 73 ; Wilson vs Life Ins. Co., 12 Pet. ( U. S. ) 140, 9 L. Ed. 1032. The reason for this rule is that the judgment of the trial court, being at law, is final between the parties, and the only matters for consideration under á writ of error are those of lawr and not of fact — errors of law upon the part of the court in omitting to rule in the progress of the trial as required by the law to do, or ruling contrary to the law. In an appeal the court of review considers the facts, as - well as the law, that appear in the record. Hence the ' writ of error “ is matter of substance, and not of form, and the parties cannot by stipulation, in the absence of the writ, confer jurisdiction. ” See 7 Ency. Pleading & Practice, 822. This court is controlled by the same law, in this regard, as the Supreme Court of the United States, as shown by the statute and decisions herein quoted. In the case of Wilson vs Ins Co., supra, where the question now before us was considered, it was. said : “ The rule of this court, therefore, is that, where there is a substantial defect in the appeal or writ of error, the objection may be taken at any time before judgment, on the ground that the case is not legally before us, and that we have not jurisdiction to try it. ” The attempt to cure the defect in the writ of error by the entry of appearance of Argo by R. S. Smith, his alleged attorney at law in this action, as set forth in the reply to the motion, does not confer jurisdiction, because of the rule above quoted from 7 Ency. Pl : & Pr., and the further reason that Argo did not undertake the cure until the time for prosecuting the writ of error had elapsed. The entry of judgment was entered July 13, 1905, and the motion to be joined as a plaintiff in error * 608was filed in this court June 14, 1906 ; the limit under the statute being six months. The motion to dismiss the writ of error is sustained, and the same is dismissed. Gill, C. J., and Townsend, J., concur.",5143016," Lawrence, J.

There is a further provision that, where it is shown by affidavit that the nonjoinder of the necessary parties is because of the incapability of their giving consent by reason of imbecility of mind, insanity, or absence from the state, the plaintiff in error may be allowed to prosecute the writ without- the joinder of such parties. The plaintiffs in error, in their verified reply to the motion to dismiss the writ of error, doubtless had this statute in view when they stated the reason for not joining therein Argo, defendant below, was because of his absence from this jurisdiction at the time of the trial, rendition of the judgment *606and the filing of the petition for writ of error,' and his residence at all such dates being unknown to plaintiffs in error, whereby his consent to such joinder could not be had. In said reply thejr conclude with prayer that the record be so amended as to now let in said Argo as a joint plaintiff in error with them. This statute .had been, by implication, repealed by the act of March 3, 1905, as above set forth, and had no application to the case at bar, for the record shows that this writ of error had been sued out subsequent to the passage of said act. And the writ, in contemplation of law, was sued out when filed in the office of the clerk of the trial court (July 22, 1905). It was decided in Brooks vs Norris, 11 How. (U. S.) 204, 13 L. Ed. 665, that “the writ of error is not brought, in the legal meaning of the term, until it is filed in the court. It is the filing of the writ that removes the record from the inferior to the Appellate Court.” And the same court, in Credit Co. vs Ark. Central Ry., 128 U. S. 258, 9 Sup. Ct. 107, 32 L. Ed. 448, say: “This decision has always been adhered to.” Says Chief Justice Fuller: “The distinction between writ of error and appeal has always been observed by this court, and has been recognized by the legislation of Congress from the foundation of the government,” —in Elliott vs Toeppner, 187 U. S. 327, 23 Sup. Ct. 133, 47 L. Ed. 200, citing Dower vs Richards, 151 U. S. 663, 14 Sup. Ct. 452, 38 L. Ed. 305; Wiscart vs Dauchy, 3 Dall. (Pa.) 321, 1 L. Ed. 619, in which last-named case Ellsworth, C. J., speaking for the majority of the court, says: “The judicial statute speaks of appeal and writ of error, but it does not confound the terms or use them promiscuously. They are to be understood, when used, aceording'to their ordinary acceptation, unless something appears in the act itself to control, modify, or change the fixed technical sense which they have previously borne. An appeal is a process of civil law origin, and removes a cause entirely, subjecting the fact, as well as the law, to a review and retrial, but a writ of error is a process of common-law origin, *607and it removes nothing for examination but the law. Does the statute observe these obvious distinctions? I think it does.'' The common law treats the writ of error as a new action, and not as the continuation of one already commenced, as we have observed. 2 Tidd's Practice, 1141; 7 Ency. Pl. & Pr. 822-860; Bank vs Jenkins, 104 111. 143; Bank vs Kerby, 9 Ark. 347; Miller vs Hoard, 6 Ark. 73; Wilson vs Life Ins. Co., 12 Pet. (U. S.) 140, 9 L. Ed. 1032. The reason for this rule is that the judgment of the trial court, being at law, is final between the parties, and the only matters for consideration under á writ of error are those of lawr and not of fact — errors of law upon the part of the court in omitting to rule in the progress of the trial as required by the law to do, or ruling contrary to the law. In an appeal the court of review considers the facts, as -well as the law, that appear in the record. Hence the' writ of error “is matter of substance, and not of form, and the parties cannot by stipulation, in the absence of the writ, confer jurisdiction.” See 7 Ency. Pleading & Practice, 822. This court is controlled by the same law, in this regard, as the Supreme Court of the United States, as shown by the statute and decisions herein quoted. In the case of Wilson vs Ins Co., supra, where the question now before us was considered, it was .said: “The rule of this court, therefore, is that, where there is a substantial defect in the appeal or writ of error, the objection may be taken at any time before judgment, on the ground that the case is not legally before us, and that we have not jurisdiction to try it.” The attempt to cure the defect in the writ of error by the entry of appearance of Argo by R. S. Smith, his alleged attorney at law in this action, as set forth in the reply to the motion, does not confer jurisdiction, because of the rule above quoted from 7 Ency. Pl: & Pr., and the further reason that Argo did not undertake the cure until the time for prosecuting the writ of error had elapsed. The entry of judgment was entered July 13, 1905, and the motion to be joined as a plaintiff in error *608was filed in this court June 14, 1906; the limit under the statute being six months. The motion to dismiss the writ of error is sustained, and the same is dismissed. Gill, C. J., and Townsend, J., concur.

7363044_1,1325,"DENSON, J This is an action of detinue, commenced on the 3rd day of November, 1903, by J. J. Johnson against J. D. Wilson, to recover a mule. The plaintiff had never had actual possession of the mule. His right to recovery is based on title under a mortgage executed to him by T. M. Skinner, on the 31st day of December, 1902, to secure a recited indebtedness of $ 450. The law day of the mortgage was October 1, 1903, and the instrument stipulates for the retention of possession by Skinner until default in the payment of the debt secured. “ Where the plaintiff in detinue bases his right of recovery, not on prior possession, but upon the strength of his title, he must prove his title ; and the defendant, unless estopped, may show any fact in derogation of such alleged title, and may therefore prove that the title is not in the plaintiff, but in a stranger. It is immaterial that the defendant fails to connect himself with such outstanding title. It is enough that the plaintiff has none, and cannot recover without it. ” — Foster v. Chamberlain, 41 Ala. 158 ; McIntosh v. Parker, 82 Ala. 238, 3 South. 19 ; Russell v. Walker, 73 Ala. 315 ; Draper v. Walker, 98 Ala. 310, 13 South. 595 On this principle, it was competent to show, in defense, prior outstanding mortgages on the mule executed by Skinner, whether defendant connected himself with them by a legal transfer or not. However, as shown by the record, there was evidence tending to show that the defendant purchased the debts and mortgages, and that they * 617were delivered to him with the mule ; and this was sufficient connéction of defendant with them to authorize their use to defeat plaintiff ’ s right of recovery by showing an outstanding title. - — 20 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law, 1028 ; O ’ Neal v. Seixas, 85 Ala. 80, 4 South. 745 ; Garham v. Newman, 21 Ala. 497. Defendant offered in evidence three mortgages antedating those of the plaintiff, all of which were past due when plaintiff ’ s mortgage was taken. They were admitted by the court against the plaintiff ’ s objection. The mortgage from Skinner to Folmar, Walden & Byrd Avas purchased by the firm of Tillis & Byrd, which latter firm succeeded the former in business, and the evidence shows that the mortgage to Tillis & Byrd was given as additional security for the debt secured by the mortgage to Folmar, Walden & Byrd. The contention of the plaintiff after the admission of the mortgages in evidencé, was that they Avere fully paid before the commencement of the suit. In respect to this issue the evidence Avas sharply in conflict. The court al - loAved the plaintiff to offer in evidence the mortgage record in which the mortgage to Tillis & Byrd was recorded, for the purpose, as the bill of exceptions recites, of shoAving that it had been marked satisfied by B. E. Byrd. This entry was shown on the margin of the record : “ Satisfied in full by order of B. E. Byrd, this Jan. 30th, 1903. Ed Roach, Judge of Probate. ” It was shown that A. B. Jernigan, a clerk in the probate office, made the entry ; but the bill of exceptions recites that it was not shown by what authority the entry was made. It is not a duty imposed by law upon the judge of probate to make such entries on the margin of mortgage records ; and, in the absence of proof of authority on the part of Jernigan or of the probate judge to make the entry, the * 618record should not have been admitted, and the court committed reversible error in admitting it. Nor is the error cured or rendered harmless by the fact that the court, in overruling defendant ’ s objection to the record, stated that, unless it was shown that the entry was made by the direction of the holder of the mortgage, it would amount to nothing, and that he would so instruct the jury. The bill of exceptions purports to set out all of the evidence, and it does not appear that any evidence of authority to make the entry was given, nor does it appear that the court instructed the jury that, in consequence of a failure to show that the entry was made by direction of the holder of the mortgage, it should not be considered. On the contrary, it appears that the court, over the objection of the defendant, permitted the plaintiff ’ s counsel to comment on the entry on the record as a circumstance tending to show payment of. the mortgage debt, and refused a request in writing by the defendant to the effect that the jury could not regard the entry on the record as evidence of payment. It follows that the errors in admitting the entry on the margin of the mortgage record, and in refusing charge 2 requested by defendant, must work a reversal of the judgment. — Bolton v. Cuthbert et al., 132 Ala. 403, 31 South. 358, 90 Am. St. Rep. 914. Charge 1, requested by the defendant, was properly refused. One contention of the plaintiff was that the payment by defendant of the debt due Tillis & Byrd was to be in extinguishment of the mortgage security, and that defendant was to hold the debt against Skinner without the mortgage, and allow him to pay it in work on defendant ’ s farm ; Skinner being defendant ’ s tenant at the time. We cannot say that there is not a tendency in the evidence supporting the contentions. There * 619fore charge 1 was bad for pretermitting this contention of the plaintiff. As the evidence will in all probability be different on another trial, we shall not consider the error assigned in respect to the refusal of charge 3, the general affirmative charge.

The second plea avers “ that the maker of the note was unable to read writing in the language in which the note was written ; and that in signing the said note, he was told and induced to believe that he was executing a contract entered into between him and the payee of the note, for the purchase of lightning rods, and the paying therefor by feeding and taking care of a certain number of horses, then owned by the payee of the note. ” The third special plea avers that “ the payee in the note represented that he was the conductor of a lightning rod company, which owned a large number of horses ; and he then proposed to appellant to give him the sum of seven dollars per head for the feeding and taking care of thirty horses per month, and to continue to do so for five months ; that he accepted this proposition, whereupon the payee in the said note proposed to put up lightning rods to appellant ’ s dwelling house and barn, and to apply the cost thereof to the payment in part for the keeping and ' feeding of said thirty head of horses. To this proposition he also assented ; and that the said Baker, the payee in the said note, then put up the lightning rods at the price of one hundred and seventy dollars. And thereupon the said Baker drew up and presented to him a paper, partly printed and partly written, in the English language ; and that he could neither read nor write the said language. That said Baker read and represented said instrument to be a promissory note, conditioned for the payment of money, but to be paid wholly in keeping and feeding of horses, as aforesaid ; and it was not to become due and payable until the amount thereof was discharged in the feeding and keeping of said horses. And that he, in full confidence in the truth of the statements so made, signed the said instrument, and thereby he was fraudulently induced to sign the same : ” Issue was joined on the several pleas, and the cause was submitted to a jury, and verdict returned for the appellee. A motion for a new trial was overruled, and judgment was rendered upon the verdict. The appellant brings the cause to this court, and assigns as error, first, the giving of the first and second instructions for the plaintiff below. We think both instructions should have been refused. In the first instruction the j ury are directed to find for the plaintiff if they believe, from the evidence, the defendant knew at the time he was signing the contract spoken of by him, that there was a note attached to it, and that the agreement spoken of by defendant in his evidence was that the note attached to it was to be paid by horse - feed ; and that the plaintiff purchased the note for value before it was due, without notice, actual or constructive, of any defense to the note. ” The fault in this instruction consists in not having any testimony upon which it can rest. The appellant is the only witness that testifies in reference to the contract, and he does not at any time state that he signed a contract with a note attached to it, but that he signed a contract or note which was conditioned to be paid in feeding and taking care of horses ; that he was sure he never signed such a paper as the note sued on ; that the paper he signed was twice as large as the note. There is another reason why these instructions should have been refused. The note is payable to O. P. Baker or bearer, and was passed to the appellee by delivery. Under Sec. 4, Chap. 98, B. S. 1874, promissory notes must be indorsed thereon under the hand of the payee, in order to vest the right of property absolutely in the assignee. And where suit is brought upon a promissory note by a person not the payee, and who becomes the owner thereof without its having been assigned, the maker can present his defense to the same extent that he could in case it was brought by the payee. Both instrucstructions are based upon the theory that if the appellee purchased the notes before maturity, without notice of any defense to the same, he stands in the position of an innocent holder. The rule of law is otherwise. Sturges v. Miller, 80 Ill. 241. We are asked, also, to reverse the judgment, upon the authority of the case of Elliott v. Levings & Co. 54 Ill. 213. In that case the ' court says : “ There is however a defect, in the proof, for which the judgment must be reversed. The bill of exceptions, which professes to contain all the evidence, sets out the note, but shows no assignment of it by the payee to the plaintiff, and the counsel for the appellant ask a reversal on this ground. ” It is so in the case before us ; and the judgment, if there was no other error, would have to be reversed for this. But the counsel for the appellee urges that the rule laid down in this case has been changed by the 8th section of chap. 98, R. S. 1874. This section was enacted in 1874, and went into force on the 1st day of July of that year, and so far as we are now informed, has in nowise been construed by the courts. The note in the case before us, as has already been observed, is made payable to “ O. P. Baker or bearer. ” In Hilborn v. Artus, 3 Scam. 344 ; and Roosa v. Crist. 17 Ill. 450, it is held that a note payable to A. B. or bearer, cannot be transferred by mere delivery, so as to vest the legal title in the holder or bearer. These cases are familiar to the bar, and we need make no quotations therefrom, in order to show the grounds upon which they rest. It is sufficient to say, such is the law. The note in suit before us has a definite payee. The term bearer is mere surplusage ; and being made payable to a person by name, the title can only pass from him by his indorsement, in pursuance of the provisions of the statute in reference to this character of paper. To apply the rule for which the counsel for the appellee contends, in the case now under consideration, we would have to reverse the order of reasoning adopted by the Supreme Court, as the basis for rule in the cases before cited upon this point. The payee would be entirely ignored — his name regarded as mere surplusage. This view is not supported by reason or authority, To hold that by the 8 th Sec. of the Chap, on negotiable instruments, the legal title to this note p > assed to the appellee by mere delivery, would be assuming that the 4th Sec. of said Chap, has been repealed by implication. The doctrine of the repeal of existing statutes by implication is not favored, and is never applied where statutes are in pari materia, except where there is an irreconcilable repugnancy. This ruléis without exception and too well understood to demand, the citation of authority. These several provisions of the statute are not repugnant, and we hold that section 8 does not in the least affect the provisions of section 4, as construed by our court, in the cases to which we have already referred. Section 4 was re - enacted by the General Assembly in 1874 without alteration, and long after it had been repeatedly construed by out Supreme Court, and its re - enactment must be presumed to have been done with the intention of continuing it in force, as construed by the courts. Other errors are assigned, but as they are of such character as would likely he corrected if another trial was had, it is unnecessary to notice them. For the errors already indicated, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.",6986849," Tanner, P. J.

3898583_1,1454,"Honorable Joe Hubenak Chairman, Committee on Agriculture and Livestock House of Representatives Austin, Texas Re : Constitutionality of H. B. 11 in ratifying actions taken to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. Dear Chairman Hubenak : You have requested our opinion concerning the effect and constitutionality of section 2 of House Bill 11, which ratifies the proceedings and actions of any political subdivision ` with respect to participation in and compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program. ' Acts 1977, 65th Leg., 1st Called Session, ch. 4, at 58. This portion of House Bill 11 was passed as a curative act to validate actions taken in such regard without proper authority. See Attorney General Opinion H - 1011 ( 1977 ). Your questions are essentially as follows : ( 1 ) Does the Texas Legislature have the power to ratify, confirm, approve, and validate past, unauthorized actions taken between June 30, 1970 and September 1, 1977, supposedly under Article 8280 - 13, V. T. C. S., by those counties and political subdivisions which had not qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program by June 30, 1970? ( 2 ) Does House Bill No. 11 destroy all those causes of action for damages, injunctive relief and / or taxpayer relief which may have arisen since June 30, 1970 against those counties and other political subdivisions which took unauthorized actions, as described above in question ( 1 )? ( 3 ) Does House Bill No. 11 violate Article I, Section 16 of the Constitution of the State of Texas, which reads : No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, retroactive law, or any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall be made. It is well established that the Legislature may validate a statute or act of a political subdivision so long as it originally had power to enact or authorize it. Perkins v. State, 367 S. W. 2d 140, 145 ( Tex. 1963 ) ; State v. Bradford, 50 S. W. 2d 1065 ( Tex. 1932 ) ; Anderson County Road Dist. No. 8 v. Pollard, 296 S. W. 1062 ( Tex. 1927 ) ; Nolan County v. State, 17 S. W. 823 ( Tex. 1891 ). Such statutes of course must be consistent with the Constitution. Article 1, section 16 has been construed to prohibit the enactment of only those retroactive laws which impair vested rights. Deacon v. City of Euless, 405 S. W. 2d 59, 62 ( Tex. 1966 ) ; Cox v. Robison, 150 S. W. 1149, 1156 ( Tex. 1912 ) ; Attorney General Opinion H - 634 ( 1975 ). Curative statutes are necessarily retroactive, since they are ` intended to act upon past transactions. . . . ' Hunt County v. Rain County, 7 S. W. 2d 648, 649 ( Tex. Civ. App. - Texarkana 1925, no writ ). Texas courts have upheld a number of curative statutes without discussion of article 1, section 16, including statutes which validate the formation of districts and their issuance of bonds and collection of taxes. Matlock v. Dallas County Arcadia Fresh Water Supply Dist. No. 1, 12 S. W. 2d 181 ( Tex. Comm ' n App. 1929, opinion adopted ) ; Anderson County Road Dist. v. Pollard, supra ; Brown v. Truscott Independent School Dist., 34 S. W. 2d 837 ( Tex. Comm ' n App. 1931, jdgmt adopted ). Similarly, want of authority to annex property has been held cured by validation. Hunt v. Atkinson, 17 S. W. 2d 780 ( Tex. Comm ' n App. 1929, jdgmt adopted ). In Matlock v. Dallas County Arcadia Fresh Water Supply Dist. No. 1, supra, the court held that taxes levied by an invalidly established water district had been validated by the Legislature and could be collected from the individual defendant. To the extent that the Texas courts have spoken on the subject, they have upheld curative statutes against claims based on article 1, section 16. Brown v. Truscott Independent School Dist., supra ; Louisiana Ry. Nav. Co. v. State, 298 S. W. 462, 466 ( Tex. Civ. App. - Dallas 1927 ), aff ' d, 7 S. W. 2d 71 ( Tex. Comm ' n App. 1928, jdgmt adopted ) ( dicta ). The failure of the courts to discuss the impact of article 1, section 16 on curative statutes suggests that it does not prohibit them. One court has, however, indicated that a validating statute cannot divest a private right acquired under a final judgment. Inman v. Railroad Comm ' n, 478 S. W. 2d 124, 129 ( Tex. Civ. App. - Austin 1972, writ ref ' d n. r. e. ). In our opinion, the courts would probably find that validating statutes may constitutionally cut off causes of actions and defenses which have not yet been secured in a final judgment. This determination would be consistent with the implications of the cases upholding curative statutes. The courts have stated that validating statutes should be liberally construed. Perkins v. State, 367 S. W. 2d 140 ( Tex. 1963 ) ; City of Mason v. West Texas Utilities Co., 237 S. W. 2d 273 ( Tex. 1951 ). They have also recognized that private persons may in good faith invest money in reliance on unauthorized actions of counties. City of Mason v. West Texas Utilities Co., supra at 275 ; see also Hunt County v. Rain County, supra at 654. In view of the public interests served by validating statutes, the courts may be reluctant to recognize new kinds of vested rights that would interfere with the implementation of such statutes. In our opinion, the courts would find that House Bill 11 destroys the causes of action you mention without violating article 1, section 16 of the Texas Constitution. SUMMARY Section 2 of House Bill 11, 65th Legislature, First Called Session, which ratifies past unauthorized actions by political subdivisions with respect to participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, is a valid exercise of legislative authority. It does not violate article 1, section 16 of the Texas Constitution and destroys any cause of action based on lack of legislative authority for the actions ratified. Very truly yours, John L.

6405417_1,483,"Wilde J. _ _ delivered the opinion of the Court. It appears by the report of the case, that only two questions of law were raised at the trial : — 1. Whether the consideration proved, were sufficient to support the promise ; — 2. And if so, whether the note subsequently given amounted to payment, and discharged the promise. That the note was given subsequently to the promise de • dared on, seems to be sufficiently proved, and we consider the fact as established by the verdict. It was not questioned at the trial ; on the contrary, the defendant then contended that the note, being negotiable, discharged the promise, and was a payment of the balance now claimed. And t would have been, but for the avoidance of it by the defendant. That this avoidance lets the plaintiff into his previously existing demand against the defendant, is proved by the case of Johnson v. Johnson, 11 Mass. R. 359. 1 As to the question of consideration, it appears that the plaintiff discharged his accounts and gave up his notes against the estate of the deceased ; which the defendant was bound to pay, having given bond to pay debts and legacies without returning an inventory. This is a sufficient consideration, whether the plaintiff ’ s security on the bond were extinguishe 1 or not. There seems, however, to be no doubt that the plaintiff ’ s remedy on the bond was extinguished by the discharge of the debt. The suggestion that the promise is void by the statute of frauds is clearly unfounded. It is not a promise by an executor “ to answer damages out of his own estate for the bond given to the judge of probate is an admission of sufficient assets, which the defendant is estopped to deny. 2 Judgment according to verdict.
